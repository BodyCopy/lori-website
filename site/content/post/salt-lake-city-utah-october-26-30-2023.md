**Thursday Oct 26**

Kristen and I started our adventure with a nice lunch at the Corner Place and then a hair raising terrifying Uber ride to the airport. Made it through rush hour traffic in record time and only added a few more gray hairs to our heads.

Sailed through customs and security with help of the “cane”. Amazing what a disability can do, though truly appreciate not having to stand in the long lines. With plenty of time to spare we had a few cocktails in the bar across from our gate.

Lots of empty seats on our plane so got to stretch out a bit. Started to watch Ted Lasso but very disappointed when we realized it was just a teaser (only three episodes). We switched to a documentary/podcast on the Harvey Weinstein take down. Partook of the airline charcuterie and a glass of wine.

Arrived late to the car rental booth so ended up getting upgraded to a jeep rubicon -sweet! We have named her GG-God’s Gift (after all we are in Mormon Country).

Our accommodations are great-very close to Kat’s place and the University. Super comfy bed as well!

**Friday October 27**

Kristen did her yoga workout, I did Duolingo. Almost from every direction you can see the mountains, some peaks already covered in snow.- spectacular!

We headed with Kat to the Red Moose for coffee and breakfast sandwiches. A cute little spot with delicious treats. Kat headed to the university to get ready for her meet and we headed to a quaint shopping area near Kat’s place called Nineth and Nineth. Wandered into an amazing gift shop that specializes in children’s books and clothing. We also went to another gift/consignment shop where Kristen got necklaces for Kat’s roommates and a witchy t-shirt for me.

We stopped at Smith’s, a grocery store to pick up cream, a charcuterie platter, snacks and dip for later on.

Drove to campus and walked over to the pool to watch the dive/swim competition with Arizona University. A little chaotic to watch as swim events are happening in the middle of the pool with diving events at the other end of the pool. Also the leader board was only showing swim results not dive results so it was hard to know what the standings were. I was also surprised that the judges were only the two university coaches and not independent of the teams.

Exciting to watch all the kids do well with their dives and not do well sometimes. We didn’t know how Kat did in the standings, so via text, Scott at home gave us the results. Turns out the posted results were not accurate -Kat ended up 4th in both her events on the 1m and 3m boards.  A little disappointing as we thought she came in second.

We left Kat with her teammates and headed to the State Liquor Store. What an adventure, this is considered a dry state so all alcohol must be purchased in a government controlled store (similar to our LCBO- but not). They have a traffic guard monitoring the comings and goings as parking is crazy with long car lines waiting to get a spot. Everyone purchasing must show picture ID regardless of age. Liked the price of wine though, Kristen and I purchased three nice bottles for $35.

From here we dropped off our purchases and headed over to Kat’s, which is literally around the corner. She lives in a nice area with cute Victorian style bungalows, all decked out in Halloween items.

We headed toward downtown and had dinner at Squatters. This restaurant has a country style/craft brewery feel. Ordering a bison burger seemed the perfect choice. While eating I noticed a man and his teen son eating at the table beside us. He fascinated me as he looked familiar, kept looking over at us and what intrigued me most was his downing four rum and cokes in the short time we were there. I thought maybe his son knew Kat as they were around the same age. More on this later…

We decided to leave the car in the parking lot of the restaurant and jump on the Trax, their above ground rail system. It conveniently let us off right in front of the Delta Arena for the Utah Jazz and LA Clipper basketball game.

We had excellent seats with great views of the court but more surprising was the fact that we were sitting right beside the father and son that were beside us in the restaurant! Now what does that mean..what are the odds!

The game was very exciting with the Jazz leading for most of the game and then Kawhi Leonard and Norm Powell poured on the steam and created a nail bitter that came down to a one possession play with the Jazz winning by a basket. Great evening out and a great way to introduce Kat to an NBA game. Would only have been better if the Jazz had been playing the Raptors.

Slowly made our way home on the Trax and then dropped Kat off at her place. Kristen and I drank wine and chatted for awhile before calling it a night.

**Saturday October 28**

Pilates and Duolingo again, then a couple of cups of coffee to drink with our blueberry and cheddar scones we brought back from the Red Moose. Very sweet but good.

It’s a beautifully sunny day so we jumped in GG and headed for the scenic drive to Park City. We drove along the canyon road climbing up the mountain on snow covered roads, Kristen concurring her fear of the steep cliff curves. We stopped half way up to take some pictures. A group of young ladies offered to take our picture asking if we were mom and daughter-ha! She quickly corrected herself, but just reminded me of the toll my back pain is taking on me. Definitely looking haggard!

We wandered Park City’s Main Street, looking into numerous art galleries showcasing beautiful pieces that are just too expensive for us. We also browsed many gift shops, purchased turquoise earrings in one store and little turtle studs in another for Kat. I was surprised by the number of shops selling indigenous goods that were clearly a sign of misappropriation. Due to the high number of these shops, it is clear that they haven’t been enlightened or just don’t care.

Time for lunch. We found a great cafe called 501 on Main. The pick two option of soup and half of sandwich was the perfect choice. We also warmed up with a cup of hot black tea.

![](/img/img_9361.jpg)

We wandered the rest of the street then headed back taking the more direct highway-still beautiful vistas of mountains on both sides.

We are still full from lunch so nibbled on charcuterie and drank wine. Kat came over and with the use of her Hulu account we started the mini series called Under the Banner of Heaven, the true crime story about the Mormon turned Fundamentalist family, the Lafferty’s that killed two of their family members. Gotta say seems appropriate to be watching this show in this city. There is Mormon influence throughout the city but more on that later.

After three episodes, lots of chips/dip and wine we called it a night.

**Sunday October 29**

Started the day with Pilates and Duolingo again. We picked up Kat in the morning and drove to Coffee Garden, a hangout spot for non Mormons to converge on a Sunday morning. Mormons don’t drink coffee and there is no Sunday shopping allowed in the whole state (obviously for religious reasons as you should be in church). Well we heathens prefer to sip excellent coffee and eat quiche.

After breakfast Kat went back to her house to write a political sci paper. Kristen and I carried on to the State Capital grounds.

Great view of the city as it is on a rise and overlooks the city. We were able to go inside the building, amazing marble everywhere and painted friezes. We also got to peek into the Supreme Court rooms and the Senate Chamber.

The Provo Canyon drive was spectacular. The mountain rock changed colours and textures as we went, towering above us as we drove through the canyon. 

![](/img/img_9383.heic)

Being in the desert there are few lakes but we did drive along a pretty one. 

![](/img/img_9378.heic)

We didn’t drive all the way to Provo but turned around and stopped in Bridal Veil Falls. The water fall was beautiful as was the meandering creek it fed into. As we drove back to Salt Lake City we followed this river.

Took a quick pit stop to Sundance resort. Classic beautiful log cabin structures and picturesque views of the mountains. We browsed their gift shop and bought cute finger puppets. Next stop - the snack bar for travel drinks and a sweet.

Even returning back the same way the return trip provided different breathtaking vistas.

Kat needed some things at Costco so off we went to the largest Costco in North America. No question it was huge, lots of selection for everything. I ended up purchasing some books and baby outfits for Elliott.  Needed to restrain Kristen from purchasing some reading material.

On our way back we stopped at East High School, the spot where High School Musical was filmed. Couldn’t resist sending Nikki and Jenna a pic.

![](/img/img_9367.jpg)

There is a cute little bistro that makes fantastic flatbreads and pasta dishes called Trios. We had a wonderful meal there.

Four episodes of Under the Banner of Heaven to binge while drinking our wine. Whole show puts a very bad light on the Fundamentalists and the Mormon Church in general.

Kristen and I finished the series, Kat headed home before the last episode. She’ll finish it later especially now that she has her roommates hooked on it.

**Monday October 30**

After doing laundry last night we packed up the condo and left the premises. Off for another short canyon drive to Ruth’s diner. Did not disappoint, excellent homemade biscuits and jam. Ordered a traditional egg/ sausage/hash brown breakfast.

We said goodbye to Kat and headed back downtown to view the temple and the Latter Day Saints section of town. Most of it was under construction but you can tell the power and wealth that is poured into these fortress like buildings. Dominates the area and drawfs the capital building. I guess a reminder to all of who really is in charge here.

Off we go to hand back GG and start the long day in airports. 

![](/img/img_9368.jpg)

Flying United and having to change planes in Denver. Smaller plane, no entertainment and relegated to back of plane in middle seat….grrrrr.

Kristen desperately trying to load United app so we can order wine. After multiple tries and a swearing incident, it finally loaded, only to disappear causing Kristen to pay for wifi to retrieve the necessary QR code. Success -we have wine. Thank god we brought sandwiches on board with us.

Great mini vacay.  Looking forward to a return trip!
