**Before December 28….**

![](/img/img_6970.jpg)

A historic snow storm hit Algonquin Highlands over the Christmas holidays. Fifty centimetres blanketed the area providing outstanding snow views. The whole family were safe inside the cottage, opening presents and cuddling by the wood burning stove. We only lost power for an hour which did not affect the turkey dinner. The whole day was truly magical, like living in a snow globe.

![](/img/img_6971.jpg)

Woke up on the 27th to more snow and the fear that we wouldn’t get out. Our fears were realized when Tim our tow plow contract phoned to say he was in the ditch on our road and wouldn’t be able to get us out. Fortunately Dave and Nikki left earlier that morning having smartly left their car up by the gray mailboxes. They graciously mid travel home turned around and came back for Giles, Brendan and me. Panic averted…we will get to the airport for tomorrow after all!

![](/img/img_6975.jpg)

Kelly and George waiting at the condo for us to arrive. Early to bed as we have to head to the airport at 2:00 am. We are off to Mexico at 6:00 a.m.

**Wednesday December 28**

Yikes 2:00 am came early but luckily no traffic to airport, breezed through security and then sat at gate waiting for coffee shops/ restaurant to open. Surrounded at the gate by loud, Uber organized family that was too much to handle at 3 in the morning. Went for breakfast where George and I had “beef bacon”. A little weird but okay.

Uneventful flight and trip to the Barcelo Maya Palace Resort. The resort is massive, with a huge convention centre, expansive hallways and lobby. Rooms are large and the bed is the size of a football field. Easily can fit six.

![](/img/img_7053.jpg)

We walked the resort and surrounding sister resorts. Great 2km boardwalk along ocean front. Windy and rocky sections along the way but excellent white sand, dotted with palm trees and beautiful vistas. Stopped at the Coral restaurant for a cocktail and to watch the sunset.

![](/img/img_7278.jpg)

![](/img/img_7263.jpg)

The buffet has plenty of choices including personal chef cooking stations. Couldn’t get into one of the a la carte restaurants tonight so steak at the buffet is on the menu for me and George. Giles had grilled grouper and Kelly sampled a variety of pre-made dishes. We have her “ I’m deathly alert to shellfish” sheet so we are good to go.

Wandered up to the funky lighted chair lounge but quickly abandoned this area due to the heavy smokers and wind. Desperately running out of speed so we settled into the comfy lounge couches and watched the big screen basketball game ( not Raptors). Tried to stay up for the arrival of Kristen and Scott, who were arriving via Montreal but we just couldn’t do it. Headed to bed in anticipation for an exciting day of sun and fun.

![](/img/img_6981.jpg)

**Thursday December 29**

Ran into Scott at the buffet this morning. They were delayed by an hour so we’re relieved that we went to bed. Got the “premium” treatment though, so a smooth check-in.  After the orientation session from Airtransat , we booked the Tulum/Cenote and a catamarán excursión for later in the week.  Took most of the morning so we strolled down the boardwalk in search of a new restaurant.

\
While walking some strange hotel guest made a grabbing motion with his hand at my breasts, as if he was going to honk them. Weird!

![](/img/img_7193.jpg)

We stopped at Captain Morgan’s a beach front restaurant for lunch. It was a buffet surrounding a pirate ship bar. I remember this bar from the time Shelley and I stayed here in 2001. Lunch was okay though the surprise lemon drop shooters the waiter brought over were delicious! Everyone thought Giles had ordered them but no one did, they just appeared-like magic. Got to love Mexican hospitality.

![](/img/img_1342.jpg)

We set up down by the beach and ventured into the ocean. Entry is tricky due to rocks hidden just under the surface. George and his delicate toes opted to stay in the Sandy shallows. I see water shoes in his future. Rest of us floated in the waves til we were waterlogged.

\
Proceeded next to the bar for more fancy cocktails. Scott tried a drink called a beer Caesar that combined cerveza and some sort of tomato liquid, making it taste like a taco. Giles and George did not approve.

![](/img/img_7008.jpg)

\
We all swam out to the pool bubblers, no happy ending here for Kelly and I but apparently Kristen was well satisfied.

\
Ate in the Mexican restaurant tonight at the taco bar. It was delicious and the wine was flowing. Restaurant personnel are attentive to Kelly’s shellfish allergy which is a relief. Lori had the trez leche cake that came with a chocolate covered grasshopper-crunchy!

![](/img/img_6992.jpg)

![](/img/img_6994.jpg)

Heard that there was a sports bar at the neighbouring resort so wandered down looking for the Raptors game. Wandered into kid hell, a loud bowling alley with yelling kids and tinny tvs-no raptors but Scott happy as they were covering the Dallas Cowboys game. Made us appreciate our Adults Only resort.

\
Eagerly left here and headed to the theatre to watch the Michael Jackson show. Did not disappoint but seemed a little long.

\
Stopped in the lobby bar for a night cap and enjoyed the live performance by a group of tenors.

**Friday December 30**

Up early for a morning of shopping on a free transportation trip to Playa del Carmen. We learned the hard way nothing is for free. Stopped at a silver factory first that put on the hard sell to purchase jewelry. Didn’t work on us but a few others on the bus got suckered in causing us to be delayed at this spot.  The tequila tasting on the upper level was a hit and an easy sell as we all purchased.

![](/img/img_6997.jpg)

Off to Playa de Carmen which turned out to be hot, crowded, and Americanized. The quaint old cobble stoned town I remember was unrecognizable. We were accosted by vendors, only blessing was we could wander and drink at the same time. Some shopping was done- a dress and shirt by Grants, belt, water shoes and Pandora charm by McCormicks and lip chap by Santyrs. While waiting for the bus we stopped at a local snack bar, the freshly fish and had chips and guacamole and colossal daiquiris and pina coladas. Yum!

![](/img/img_7001.jpg)

![](/img/img_7002.jpg)

![](/img/img_7004.jpg)

Raining on return trip back, though Scott missed this as he was nodding off in the front seat. All decided it was a good time to take a nap before heading to dinner.

McCormick’s still plagued by a stinky room. Hoping to have it fixed today.

Tonight we are sampling the French restaurant. Am getting lots of Spanish speaking practice. Waiters are great at accommodating my butchered pronunciations. Meals were plentiful and really delicious.

We were all so satiated with food and drink just laid on the loungers by the pool. Kristen fell asleep in hammock almost immediately. All decided to call it an early night.

![](/img/img_7005.jpg)

**Saturday December 31**

Santyrs continue to have electrical issues: no wifi in room, then wristband keys won’t open the door and now the safe won’t open. Everything comes in threes so this should be the last of the problems…I hope.

We grabbed six lounge chairs near some hammocks and settled in for a day at the pool and beach. Weather is spectacular, no clouds and 29 degrees Celsius. Pool is refreshing and having the swim up bar soooo convenient. Kristen and Scott discovered that at the “activity” pool, the bubblers there do provide a happy ending. We’re amused to see some lady taking full advantage of the situation. Kristen jumped in to give it a try only to be blasted off the jet by the force of it. We are all going to give it a go later on.

![](/img/img_7013.jpg)

![](/img/img_7012.jpg)

The beach swim was excellent, with George using new water shoes to come into the waves. First time in the ocean since eighth grade. Waves were more impressive today, needed to stay alert so that they didn’t swamp you.

For lunch we walked down to the Coral restaurant. Fun to try new locations and they all have something a little different at the buffet. Today it was marinated mussels and fruit cocktails with hot sauce. Most of us walked back barefooted, seems we are all suffering from sandy sandal blisters.

![](/img/img_7216.jpg)

Back to the pool for more Miami vice and sombrero drinks.

Quick naps and then cocktails in the lobby bar before heading to the Italian restaurant for dinner. It was a set menu of steak or lobster as the main tonight with warm barata salad or smoked salmon salad and prawn bisque or pumpkin bisque. Dessert was Ferrero Roches cake-we all ate too much again! We did learn though that George is the president and only fan member of the Kelly clam club and according to Scott, Pablo Escobar will be singing tonight at the hotel lobby bar.

![](/img/img_7025.jpg)

![](/img/img_7026.jpg)

Headed to the convention centre for the New Years Eve show. Terribly understaffed so Scott and Lori headed to the bar to snag some drinks. By the time we got back to the table the waiter had brought the ordered ones. Double the trouble! Yummy champagne for the countdown! Mariachi band and Mexican scenic landscape video was the show. Not overly impressive so we headed to the lobby bar for more mariachi music. 

![](/img/img_7038.jpg)

Got all the guys up dancing and throwing caution to the wind Scott ordered tequila shots for everyone.  

![](/img/img_7041.jpg)

![](/img/img_7043.jpg)

Shortly after we all headed off to bed!

\
**Sunday January 1st**

Up relatively early given the hang over that is imminent. Scott off to hydrotherapy to sweat his hangover out. Rest of us headed to the pool for a morning plunge.

A cute “nurses” station set up at the buffet for those brave enough to order a Bloody Mary. Hair of the dog!

![](/img/img_7054.jpg)

Off on our catamaran and snorkeling adventure. We all sat at the front on the lower netting to capture the wave spray. Crew greeted us with fresh juices and then we were off. None of the crew seemed to be alarmed by the large funnel cloud in the distance. It was amazing to see it snake down to the water, producing a water spout.

![](/img/img_7067.jpg)

We headed toward Playa del Carmen and stopped at a protected cove to snorkel. Beautiful little fish, lots of Dora’s but no sea turtles. It was a real workout navigating the waves, adjusting to breathing and avoiding touching the coral. George stayed on the boat and took photos. Not interested in swimming or maybe just didn’t want the fish to go after his “beans and taco”.

![](/img/img_7056.jpg)

Fortunately our group enjoyed the sail unlike some of the guests that were hurling over the side of the boat. After the snorkel they provided us with plenty of tropical drinks and a delicious lunch. Even managed to accommodate Kelly’s allergy, preparing hers separately in the galley kitchen.

![](/img/img_7060.jpg)

![](/img/img_7066.jpg)

Went back for a well deserved rest and then met up in the lobby bar for drinks before dinner. All the regular bartenders off today- asked for a vodka martini-got straight vermouth in olive juice. Giles rescued the day by heading into the bar and getting me a real martini.

Dinner was spectacular tonight at the Japanese restaurant. The ginsu chef prepared our surf and turf dinner in front of us putting on quite a show. Again, ate too much.

![](/img/img_7074.jpg)

Night cap in the lobby bar (better drink) this time. All headed to bed early .

![](/img/img_7253.jpg)

**Monday January 2**

Dotted throughout the resorts are trainers with hawks. Initially we thought they were for picture opportunities but now we think they are used to chase the birds away from the lounge and buffet areas. Ingenius!

This morning is a pool day and a beach swim. Kelly snoozed in the clam shell bed while George, Giles and I read in our lounge chairs. Kristen and Scott headed back to Playa del Carmen to visit with friends they haven’t seen for a number of years.

![](/img/img_7279.jpg)

George Kelly, Giles and Lori walked the beach and had lunch at the Sante Fa Buffett. Then we headed down the back road in a hunt for iguana’s. Didn’t have to search long as there were many dotting the roadside.

![](/img/img_7108.jpg)

Late in the afternoon Scott and Kristen went up to their room to watch the Rose Bowl. Kat is at the game representing the University of Utah. Unfortunately they didn’t win. The rest of us headed to the lobby bar to watch the Eagles video show-no such luck, Justin Timberlake instead. Drinks were welcome and plentiful so no problema!

Tonight we are eating in the French restaurant. We all tried something different and less a course. We all agreed, still too much food.

![](/img/img_7239.jpg)

Nightcaps at the bar and then early to bed. Hoping to see the rest of the Raptors game on tv but unfortunately it wasn’t televised.

**Tuesday January 3**

![](/img/img_7135.jpg)

Full day planned with a guided tour to Tulum and then a cenote. Travelling in style in one of the big comfy air conditioned coaches, took awhile to get to the ruins as we picked up a number of others at different resorts.

Our tour guide Thomas has an amazing ability of switching back and forth in English and Spanish effortlessly. Lori was able to follow most of it which she was quite pleased about.

The archeological site of Tulum has changed quite a bit since Lori and Giles visited it last. Large number of gift shops, restaurants, Starbucks grace the site now. Before getting to the ruins you have to wade through the vendors wanting you to take pictures with iguanas, pythons and lemurs.

Thomas gave a comprehensive talk about the ruins and their connection to the solstice calendar and the customers of the Mayan people prior to the colonization by the Spanish. The temples and building have lasted 1000 years being built literally on the backs of the poor mayans for the royals.

![](/img/img_7118.jpg)

![](/img/img_7124.jpg)

![](/img/img_7138.jpg)

![](/img/img_7136.jpg)

Before heading to the cenote we stopped at Bonita Maria’s cafe for tacos, cold cervezas and pina coladas.

![](/img/img_7144.jpg)

Off we go to the cenote which will be very welcome after the heat of Tulum. This is an above ground cenote called the casa de tortuga. 

![](/img/img_7154.jpg)

![](/img/img_7157.jpg)

The water is refreshing and provided lots of spots for steep jumping. Kelly and Lori looked on as Scott, Kristen and Giles made the plunge. 

![](/img/img_7159.jpg)

![](/img/img_7162.jpg)

George ventured into the cenote but stayed close to the stairs as he was unsure when the bottom would drop off. Instead he became our resident photographer.

![](/img/img_7177.jpg)

On our way out we noticed a cave cenote despite being worried, Giles and Kelly ventured into it, liked it so much they convinced Kristen, Scott and Lori to go through it as well. As they were going into the cave, overheard a mom telling her young daughter- Fear is only in your mind, you can not be afraid until you are actually in the experience -good advice!

![](/img/img_7207.jpg)

![](/img/img_7210.jpg)

George bought Kelly some silver earrings on the way out at one of the gift shops. Much better prices than at Tulum and Play del Carmen.

![](/img/img_7202.jpg)

![](/img/img_7182.jpg)

![](/img/img_7186.jpg)

Some of us napped on the way back and then continued the rest up in our rooms. Lori strategically maneuvered into the jet tub on the balcony for her rest.

\
Drinks at the bar before eating another delicious meal at the Mexican restaurant. Lori and Giles had the best ceviche that they have ever had. All ate too much again.

![](/img/img_7211.jpg)

We went back to the lobby bar for nightcaps. Lori and Giles retired to the balcony hot tub, Scott and Kristen headed to hammocks by the pool and George and Kelly brought their drinks back to their room.

Big day tomorrow- Kelly’s 52nd birthday!

**Wednesday January 4**

We started Kelly’s birthday with a round of mimosas and then walked her down for her deep tissue massage and hydrotherapy sessions. Two hours later we collected her and headed to Captain Morgan’s for the buffet lunch. Had to wrestle the young kids for a plate of fries. Again, we are all appreciative of our adults only section.

Giles and George headed to the beach to surprise us with three Pineapple speciality “face” drinks. Delicious and best part is we can keep refilling them at the bar.

![](/img/img_7226.jpg)

![](/img/img_7237.jpg)

Despite the red flag we ventured into the ocean, trying carefully to navigate the rocks just under the surface. Once we reached the sandy section we stayed and played in the waves.

Back to the Japanese restaurant tonight where yet again we all overate and drank. Our waiter was extra attentive tonight!

![](/img/img_7240.jpg)

\
The lobby bar was showing the Raptors game so watched them eventually lose in overtime. Fun to see them on the jumbo screen.

![](/img/img_7269.jpg)

Kelly and Kristen went out to the open area to snag some glow chairs for us only to be harassed by a very drunk hotel guest. Even the rest of us showing up to claim the seats couldn’t get rid of him. Eventually Kelly dragged him to his feet and pushed him along. Management eventually took him away.

We all managed to stay awake long enough to see the rock band. Fun times and a great birthday day for Kelly.

![](/img/img_7243.jpg)

**Thursday January 5**

Another beautiful day with spectacular weather.. the waves are smaller today but beach is littered with seaweed and plastic from yesterdays waves. Crews are working hard today to get everything cleaned up.

\
Spent most of the day hanging by the pool, swimming, reading, drinking, lying on the floating beds, more drinking and then some more drinking. We ordered iced coffees with baileys. Each time we ordered the drink a new version would arrive. Became the mystery drink of the day.

![](/img/img_7264.jpg)

Scott forgot his towel on the catamaran days ago so yesterday he cleverly picked up another that was forgotten by the beach showers, only to have his towel taken by someone else today…karma. Fortunately the towel lady at the pool bar gave him another one after he tipped her a few US dollars.

While walking along the beach Giles found a waterlogged beanie baby stuffed animal that had washed up along the shore. Who knows maybe it came all the way from Cuba. He left it in the family section hoping someone will clean it up and take it home.

While swimming in the pool we enjoyed watching a pelican dive into the surf feeding on a school of fish.

![](/img/img_7276.jpg)

Giles, George, Kelly and Lori hopped on the double decker hotel shuttle and went over to the Mayan Mall. The mall consists of high end jewelry and clothing stores and a Mexican craft section. Kelly purchased some Louis Vuitton knock off purses and Lori got some spicy margarita dimmer and a leather Bills bookmark for Dave’s birthday. We took the shuttle back which did a slow circuit around each of the resorts. This place is huge and has so much to offer!

![](/img/img_7249.jpg)

While having our pre dinner cocktail in the lobby we were surrounded by about a hundred ladies all wearing white dresses. Apparently they are part of a cosmetic/laser work function out of Vancouver-clearly we work in the wrong industries, no work trips for us!

![](/img/img_7250.jpg)

Dinner tonight at the Italian restaurant did not disappoint. Wine and food just kept coming.

Tonight’s entertainment was ill Divo (opera singers). Though after lemon drop, Spider-Man and Scooby doo shooters, all of us headed out separate ways. Lori and Giles curled up in a clam shell to gaze at the full moon. When we decided to head up to the room, we discovered our door keys wouldn’t work..again. Back to the lobby, so got to hear the opera singers after all. Witnessed lots of drunk ladies in white dresses!

**Friday January 6**

Last day in paradise! Luckily our flights are at 8:30 p.m. so we don’t have to leave on the airport shuttle until 3:15 p.m.  We had a late brunch at the buffet and then hung out at the pool. Another perfect weather day so we were able to soak up the sun one last time.  Most of us snuck sandwiches out of the buffet later in the afternoon for our dinner at the airport.  Uneventful trip to the airport, just lots of traffic.

Great time had by all!   Hasta Luego Mexico
