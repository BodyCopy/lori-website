**Thursday December 19th**

Night before we leave. Jenna and Jon spending the night as we have to be up really early.

Giles and I went to see Anastasia at the Mirvish Theatre on Yonge. Sets and costumes were amazing, singing and songs not so great.

Nikki, Robin and Brendan already in Hawaii on island of Kauai. Looking forward to seeing them in a couple of days.

**Friday December 20th**

Taxi picked us up at 5:00 am. Sandy already texting from airport that it’s super busy. She wasn’t kidding, wall to wall people with long lines snaking through security and customs. Lots of anxious faces, thinking they might miss their connections including our own. Made our first flight of three with minutes to spare before boarding started. Flight path took us to Chicago, then LA the finally Honolulu without incident. Long flights but at least we made all the connections.

Arrived in Honolulu at 8:00 pm. Walked over to Waikiki Beach, had dinner and drinks at the Outrigger Reef restaurant. Our table was right at beach level with the high tide and rain the mist could be felt on our faces. Tacos, tostadas and sliders were consumed as well as beers, wine and G and T’s.

Back to the Holiday Inn express for an early night as our flight to Kauai leaves at 6:20 tomorrow morning. Too bad it is rainy and overcast, we are on the 44th floor, I’m sure the view is probably spectacular.

**Saturday December 21st**

Get to see Nikki today! It’s been at least six months. So glad everyone will be together this holiday. Quick flight, then stops at Walmart and the Safeway to purchase food for the week. Stopped at a local market where Jon and Jenna bought a coconut drink, papayas, radishes and some huge oranges.

![](/img/img_2069.jpg)

At the airport terminal, Sandy managed to pee in her pants while squatting to AVOID the seat. We all had a good laugh over that. Giles was disturbed by the whole event.

Arrived at our unit at the Princeville Plantation. Great spot, all of us have our own en-suite, the lanai over looks the pool and hot tube area. Robin and Brendan’s place is close by. So great to see Nikki again. Great to see the kids all hanging out. Brendan shared a hilarious story of pulling into the grocery parking lot and seeing a good looking surfer dude and commented loud enough for him to hear: “Hey have you met my sister?” Then rolled the back seat window down to show off an embarrassed Nikki. The guy thought it was funny, smiled and laughed. Ah brotherly love!

![](/img/img_2205.jpg)

As it is still raining we made pizzas and reminisced about past trips . Confusion was evident on Robin and Sandy’s faces as we talked about the poisonous walking stick...took awhile to distinguish we were talking about a walking bug vs walking stick.

Strolled in the rain around the streets looking for a hidden passage down to the beach . After asking three people and backtracking twice we finally found it. Totally a local secret as you have to go on private property first before finding the service road. A very steep and narrow path that was slippery due to the rain eventually led to a private beach and waterfall. Robin and Brendan swam, Jon beach combed and the rest of us wandered the beach. Surprisingly no one took a header despite the treacherous footings. This is known as the Seaforth Beach and Falls.  

![](/img/img_1836.jpg)

Us old folks headed back to the condo while the kids went in search of the falls. They found it and even went into the cold spring water. 

![](/img/img_1858.jpg)

Once back, a swim, hot tub and afternoon cocktails were welcome. Rain continues but luckily the lanai is well protected. Made chicken fajitas for dinner, Robin, B and Nikki contributed their leftover beans and rice and Nikki made delicious mai-tai’s. kids enjoyed hanging out in the lanai playing “president”.

**Sunday December 22nd**

Up early, still overcast and rainy. Sandy went for an early morning walk around the condo unit, Jenna and Jon slept in a little and Giles prepared the breakfast: fruit salad, yogurt, toast and oatmeal. I did some research of our options today. Weather seems to be marginally better on the south shore.

Brendan, Robin and Nikki joined us for breakfast then we headed off. Stopped at their condo which is a couple minutes drive away. They have a great spot too.

Drove along the coast, waves very high and rough. Travelled thru the tree tunnel on hwy 520 which is a grove of eucalyptus trees that enclose the roadway.

Arrived at Poi’pu Beach Park, fairly empty for a Sunday. Only the crazy tourists out in this rainy misty weather. Grabbed a covered canopy and set up all our gear. Large sea turtle on beach as well as a juvenile monk seal.

![](/img/img_1878.jpg)

Brendan and Robin attempted to body surf at Brennecke Beach however rocks made it difficult to manoeuvre. No wonder they nickname this spot-Breakneck Beach. Snorkeling turned out great in the sheltered bay. We saw numerous colourful fish such as Aha needlefish, Butterflyfish, Moray eel, Enenue Lowfin fish, and the Uhu Bullethead Parrotfish

![](/img/img_1883.jpg)

Nikki brought a beach ball toss game. Robin and Nikki were the champions. Cold and damp so packed up and headed to The Spouting Horn. Robin and Brendan saw a whale in distance and everyone saw large turtle swimming near geyser hole.

![](/img/img_1897.jpg)

![](/img/img_1907.jpg)

Went to a local coffee stop called the Little Fish Coffee Shop. Neat combinations of flavours, three of had Monkey Nuts Smoothies, so yummy. (Peanut butter, almond milk, and chocolate chips).

![](/img/img_e1881.jpg)

Went to Moir Gardens, a great wild cacti free garden on a repurposed plantation site. Beautiful large varieties surrounding volcanic rock pools. Got some great photos.

![](/img/img_e1925.jpg)

![](/img/img_1937.jpg)

![](/img/img_1941.jpg)

Headed back to the condo for a BBQ and hot tub soak. We could hear B, Robin and Nikki approaching as the had their portable speaker blaring our Costa Rica theme song: viva los party, viva los noche - what the fuck!” This prompted an impromptu dance party in the kitchen!

![](/img/img_1947.jpg)

Broke into teams and worked on escape room games. Giles, Sandy, Nikki and I worked on the stranded island. Jon, Jenna, Brendan and Robin had a castle themed one. Should of taken a couple of hours however three hours later we are all still trapped. Sandy bailed after one hour claiming her brain hurt! Both teams eventually succeeded in escaping!

HALF ARTHUR!

**Monday December 23rd**

Off to Ha’ena State Psrk today. Hoping the weather cooperates. The park and trails have been closed due to wet conditions. In luck, open and even a sun sighting.

Sandy, Giles and I based ourselves on the first beach, Ke’e Beach while everyone else did the 4 mile hike up to the second beach. They did it in record time finding a natural spring that Nikki described as “heaven” and the most refreshing thing she’s ever done. They also swam at the beach and explored a hidden cave they found. 

![](/img/20191223_181232.jpg)

We swam in the water as well, picnicked on the beach and watched two humpback whales breech in front of us. Even managed to get a photo. Giles snorkelled, unfortunately no turtle sightings.

![](/img/img_e1954.jpg)

Tonight we went to the Kalamaku Plantation for their Luau. Beautiful grounds with the dinner and show being performed in the round under a large tent. Open bar got this party started with consumption of beers, mai tai’s, bourbons and Blue Hawaiians. 

![](/img/img_1959.jpg)

![](/img/img_e1956.jpg)

Buffet style dinner had us sampling roasted pork, which they had just removed from an underground pit, served with poi. The show was very entertaining and visually appealing with fire, traditional dance and music.

![](/img/img_1963.jpg)

![](/img/img_1967.jpg)

Good thing Jenna was driving! Wild ride home with Jon cranking the tunes and the rest of us singing and seat dancing all the way home. With a quick pee break at the side of the road for Nikki! Party continued back at the condo for some of us. Robin not feeling well do they walked home shortly after returning. Jenna and Nikki having fun mimicking Giles, Sandy, Lori and their own dance moves.

![](/img/received_529837570941748.jpeg)

**Tuesday December 24th**

Slow start to the day. A wall of rain...what to do? Brendan and Robin grabbed the surf board and headed to Hanalei Bay. Spent an hour there catching the waves until fatigue set in. They headed to Waimea Canyon. More on that later.

Jon woke up with a cold so decided to chill in the condo. The rest of us headed to the town of Hanalei to do some shopping. Giles and Sandy had run out there earlier to pick up a fresh fish for dinner. Unfortunately by the time we arrived the rain storm had knocked out the power so nothing was opened. Headed south to Kailua to see the lighthouse. Unfortunately that was closed as well and the rain was pouring down. Did a little shopping in the town( we looked, Jenna shopped). Stopped for lunch in a small bakery/ cafe. Food good but expensive.

From there headed down to Ka’paa to the Safeway for dinner provisions. Insane traffic jam but managed to get what we needed. Headed back to the condo where we went directly to the hot tub to warm up.

![](/img/img_2169.jpg)

Brendan and Robin arrived shortly after soaked to the bone. Drove to Waimea Canyon, couldn’t hike due to rain and the view was a wall of white fog. Bought a pie on the way back.

![](/img/img_1864.jpg)

Had a great grilled fish dinner then played the traditional Yahtzee game. Despite everyone getting a Yahtzee, Jon won without getting Yahtzee ( it’s all about the bonus!).

![](/img/img_2171.jpg)

**Wednesday December 25th**

Merry Christmas! Had cinnamon buns and home made waffles for breakfast. Giles not feeling well so stayed in bed for the morning. Still raining but cleared up by noon. Huge storm last night, power lines down, flash flooding-road to Hanalei closed due to a mud slide.

Jenna and Jon surprised me with my own blog set up. She took some of my Facebook trip photos to create the introduction. Love it! So looking forward to putting my travel notes onto it.

Drove to Anini State Park, long sandy beach with gentle entry in. Large fallen tree in water with a rope swing, Robin, Nikki and Jenna swam to it. Robin went to grab the log and put her hand on a fist sized crab! We had a couple of hours of fun until a windy rain system started to come in. Headed to Princeville hoping for Poke for lunch but place was closed.

![](/img/img_2003.jpg)

![](/img/img_2006.jpg)

![](/img/img_2008.jpg)

![](/img/img_2010.jpg)

Pool and hot tub in late afternoon. Ham and scallop potatoes for Christmas dinner. Brendan and Robin had to leave tonight. Rest of us watched Love Actually.

![](/img/img_2011.jpg)

![](/img/img_2013.jpg)

**Thursday December 26th**

Looks like it’s going to be a nice day. Some confusion over what to do, difficult when you only have one vehicle. Sandy and Nikki took the bikes for a spin while we sorted out what to do.

Booked river kayaks for tomorrow so decided to drop Jenna and Jon off at the botanical gardens in Poi’pu then we’ll head to the canyon or better known as the cannon.

![](/img/img_2017.jpg)

Botanical Gardens were devastated in latest storm so centre closed. Welcome to walk around areas immediately surrounding gift shop. Did this but really nothing special to see. All headed on to Waimea Canyon Drive.

![](/img/img_2016.jpg)

Spectacular views as you wind up the mountain. The reds of the stone and the greens of the vegetation are breathtaking. Went to the very top to view the Napoli Coast but unfortunately shrouded in cloud cover. Very cool to be in the clouds!

![](/img/img_2019.jpg)

![](/img/img_2025.jpg)

![](/img/img_2027.jpg)

Went to museum lookout to get a trail map. Due to recent rains most are too dangerous to hike. Started out on a forest trail, the Kuluapuha. Very soggy and mud slick, only went about a half kilometre and decided to abort.

![](/img/img_2034.jpg)

Drove to the Cliff and Canyon Trail entrance, figured if we were going to be covered in mud their needed to be a reward at the end: spectacular views and a waterfall! Difficult going down a dirt road, then onto narrow windy trail. Having a walking stick really helped! Sandy decided to go back at this point after seeing Jon slip twice. Rest of us continued on the two hour hike. We were not disappointed, you could hear the helicopters in the canyon prior to emerging around a bend to a steep drop off down into the canyon. Simply amazing vista, sun shining highlighting the vivid reds, greens and yellows. Waterfall was nice but underwhelming compared to the views.

![](/img/img_2035.jpg)

![](/img/img_2041.jpg)

Started to lightly rain as we made our way to the car. While driving out we stopped at lookouts on the way down the canyon road and were rewarded with a rainbow.

![](/img/img_2062.jpg)

![](/img/img_2071.jpg)

Drove to the town of Waimea for shave ice at Jo Jo’s, walked to the beach to see the first sunset since we have been here.

![](/img/img_2081.jpg)

Headed back home for a well deserved hot tub to soothe aching knees and legs. Yummy spaghetti dinner.

**Friday December 27th**

Hoping for a sunny day and we were rewarded with one about mid morning. Stopped at a garden centre near our condo which was beautifully laid out with water features. They had a variety of rain chains, I purchased one that has small brass buckets.

Prior to heading to our kayak outing we stopped in Ka’paa for a juice and walk along the boardwalk. Also made dinner reservations at Sam’s Oceanfront.

![](/img/img_2088.jpg)

We were late to our kayak appointment due to the severe traffic jam leaving Ka’paa. Luckily so was everyone else. Jenna and Jon paddled off in their tandem kayak. Nikki and Sandy in individual ones trailed behind with Giles and I in the middle. The paddle on the Wailua River was fairly straightforward, surrounded by hibiscus shrubs on both sides. After a 30 minute paddles we came to a small beach were everyone leaves their kayak to head down the trail to the waterfalls. The area is literally littered with kayaks all looking identical so remembering your identification number is a must. The area was recently ravaged by a fast flood so wasn’t the nicest looking.

![](/img/img_2143.jpg)

![](/img/img_2145.jpg)

![](/img/img_2147.jpg)

Quite the adventure thru the forest to the waterfall. Extremely muddy and slippery conditions. Jenna and Sandy both fell in the mud and Jon’s water shoes kept getting stuck so he did most of the trail barefooted.

![](/img/img_2093.jpg)

![](/img/img_2098.jpg)

![](/img/img_2106.jpg)

Well worth the effort though. Waterfall was spectacular. We were able to wade in, falling water felt like needles pricking the skin.

![](/img/img_2119.jpg)

![](/img/img_2120.jpg)

On walk back ran into a crazy tour guide leading about 30 people in late in the afternoon. She became irate when we tried to pass. Ended up telling Sandy and another guy that she hoped they fell off a cliff and no one rescued them. Sandy told her that she needed to go to guide training school!

Our dinner and ocean view at Sam’s was awesome. We all partook of the happy hour specials: martini’s, beers and mai tais. Everyone’s dinner was delicious.

![](/img/img_2161.jpg)

Went to the hot tub but unfortunately full of people from Oregon who were annoying so didn’t stay long.

Last night of a great week on Kauai!

**Saturday December 28th**

Drove into Hanalei Bay for a specialty coffee and some shopping/browsing. Couldn’t spend too much time as we had to get to the airport for mid day. Able to stop briefly at the Wailua Falls. Not as impressive as the river falls but still nice to see.

Well our adventures getting to Maui started with our flight being cancelled, put on standby and having to wait two flights before being placed. Ended up being rerouted to the other airport, now having to get cab vouchers to the west side of the island. Our car rental is at the other airport so will have to go pick up cars in the morning. Luckily that airport is only 5 minutes away.

Our cab driver was very friendly and played a promotional Maui video as we travelled the 50 minutes to our condo.

Arrived in the dark and hungry so quickly dropped everything off and walked to the nearest plaza. Very dark with no street lights so used our cell phones to light the way. Arrived in time for all the restaurants to be closing so our only option was to purchase the last two roasted chickens and a few salads.

Our place is a little dated and small for six. The two bathrooms are upstairs either the two bedrooms. Jenna and Jon are on the couch in the living room. We have two lanai’s, upper and lower but furniture isn’t the mist comfortable or appealing.

**Sunday December 29th**

Giles, Jenna and I got up early to catch an Uber to the Avis rental centre. Luckily it was only 5 minutes away. They were really friendly and efficient. Had us in our two Jeeps and away in record time. Headed over to the Times grocery store to provision for the week.

![](/img/img_2320.jpg)

Then grabbed coffees at the Java Jazz Cafe.

Headed to Ka’anapali Beach, found a small sheltered section to set up umbrella near the Hyatt. Great boardwalk runs length of the beach. Gentle surf so we’re able to swim.

![](/img/img_2194.jpg)

While snorkelling we saw numerous small fish and then Giles spotted what we were all waiting for: a giant sea turtle! It was amazing to be able to swim right beside it. So amazing watching him eat the coral. Unfortunately some idiot decided to get too close and touch it which caused the turtle to swim away. First of many sighting I hope!

![](/img/img_2195.jpg)

The Hyatt has a great grotto bar which serves a killer pina colada. Extremely refreshing to sip our drinks and float in the grotto pool with a waterfall.

![](/img/img_2198.jpg)

![](/img/img_2200.jpg)

Headed back to our unit in time for a swim in the warm pool and watch the sunset. The grounds and ocean side seating is quite ample. Beach area is very narrow but surf is manageable.

![](/img/img_2202.jpg)

Had a great steak, potato and salad dinner on the lanai. We all partook in some well deserved liquid lanai!

Watched an old 80’s classic: Gremlins after dinner.

**Monday December 30th**

Later start this morning, then off to Lahaina, the main town. Long strip of shops bordering the ocean that clearly cater to tourists and the cruise ships that come into town. Highlight is the largest Banyan tree in the US that spans almost an acre. It is incredible and provides much needed shade.

![](/img/img_2208.jpg)

![](/img/img_2209.jpg)

![](/img/img_2211.jpg)

Nikki purchased gold stud shell earrings as she lost one yesterday. We all went for lunch at Down the Hatch, a lower level market restaurant. Tacos, ahi sandwiches and lava lava shrimp were consumed.

We drove down the coastal highway to the south beaches. Miles and miles of beautiful sandy beaches and vistas. We stopped at Kama’ole Beach 1 and perched ourselves under a palm tree on the grassy hill overlooking the beach. The sand is very fine and the surf not too strong today. Water was refreshing after the open Jeep ride in the full sun.

![](/img/img_2227.jpg)

Nikki and I tried to snorkel near the rocky edge but current was strong, visibility not so great and only a few fish. At one point we were surrounded by a small school of silver fish.

Giles and Nikki played boules, a ball toss game in the park while the rest of us swam.

![](/img/img_2237.jpg)

Stayed for the sunset that was quite impressive. Took lots of photos, some were quite hilarious, especially the one where Sandy looks like Chass Bono. We had a good belly laugh!

![](/img/img_2261.jpg)

![](/img/img_2267.jpg)

![](/img/img_e2244.jpg)

![](/img/img_e2250.jpg)

Great drive back along the coast in the twilight. BBQ’d pork tenderloin for dinner.

**Tuesday December 31st**

Raining lightly this morning so me and Giles headed to the grocery store in search of fish and veggies for tomorrow’s dinner. We also grabbed great coffees at the Coffee Stop.

Jon and Jenna have decided to do a down day so Sandy, Nikki, Giles and I headed to the north coast. We are in search of Slaughterhouse Beach and Honolua Bay for reported good snorkeling. No signage in the roadway and ocean extremely rough this morning so we missed the entrance to these areas. Stopped at a few lookout points, incredible cliffs and swells.

![](/img/img_2278.jpg)

![](/img/img_2281.jpg)

Did the Ohai Trail Hike trail along the coast. Could see the Nakalele Pt., blow hole from a distance. Half way we came across a rock sculpture garden that we each added too. Tricky to keep your rocks balanced in the wind.

![](/img/img_2293.jpg)

![](/img/img_2295.jpg)

Went in search of the Olivine pools but missed that pull off too. I think the surf is too strong and they are flooded over right now.

Travelled a hair raiding switchback road (#340) that was windy with one lane access and hairpin turns. Nikki felt sick in the back but no where to pull off. This went on for about 9 miles. Outstanding cliffs, valleys and coastal views.

![](/img/img_2289.jpg)

Drove to Waihee Beach and had our picnic lunch. Place fairly deserted. Surf a little strong and wind still up so none of us swam. Can’t get over how many abandoned cars we come across. Some look like people may be living in them.

On way back we stopped at the Iao Needle monument, State Park to view river stream with small waterfalls. Headed back for a rest before the nights festivities.

![](/img/img_2315.jpg)

![](/img/img_2319.jpg)

![](/img/img_2323.jpg)

**New Year's Eve**

Had a quick bbq of hamburgers and chips for dinner then headed down to Lahaina for New Year’s Eve. Went to the Dirty Monkey, bar which was having a roaring 20’s theme. Most people in casual dress though. Got their early enough that we didn’t need to pay cover and got a lounge section to hang out in.

![](/img/81650951_613221722774107_2575824524591235072_n.jpg)

![](/img/82395084_452552852108047_8389193498531725312_n.jpg)

Sandy made friends quickly when the table behind us were playing dare jenga. One of the guys had to dance with a stranger and chose Sandy. Chatted with that group for most of the night. Young drunk Joe seemed to be enthralled with me. Bartender cut him off at one point but by end of night he was drinking again. 

![](/img/img_2333.jpg)

Nikki met a nice girl from Washington DC and her roommate Anthony. Many drinks later ( pickle back shots and beers), Nikki was found making out with Anthony behind a post! Jon also got into the shots and was feeling no pain. Jenna and Giles, our two DD’s watched in amusement. Good night had by all.

![](/img/82606631_1424106717795985_1532749626078134272_n.jpg)

**Wednesday January 1st 2020**

Got up early to try to reserve car passes to the Haleakalā sunrise. Managed to get one car pass only, we will have to figure something out.

Most went back to bed slightly hungover. Nikki, Sandy, Giles and I decided to go to the beach. Attempted to park near Black rock however struggled to find the right road, then a public parking lot then got in wrong parking area and couldn’t back up easily. Nerves and tempers glared. Nikki threatening to puke so we went to the Hyatt parking lot again which luckily still had spots.

Giles and I walked down the pathway to Black rock and snorkelled there. Visibility very good but water extremely deep so saw fish at multiple levels . Swam beside a small turtle until he dove deep into a cave.

Kaanapali Beach area is really beautiful with delicious resorts, and shops. Ideal place to stay as a couple.

Sandy and I snorkelled in front of our chairs and this time went further out, seeing loads of colourful fish, schools of bright yellow fish and a huge turtle. Highlight was swimming beside the turtle. He let me get so close, at one point we were staring at each other.

Jenna and Jon stayed at the condo today going out for yummy fish tacos. They are preparing our fish dinner tonight for us. Pretty perfect way to start the new year!

![](/img/img_2273.jpg)

**Thursday January 2nd**

Early start today, heading to the highway to Hana reported to be the most beautiful drive in all of Hawaii. This trip did not disappoint. The lush tropical forest was simply amazing. Around every windy curve and hairpin turn was another incredible vista, whether it was ocean views, magnificent waterfalls, or dense forest cover, it was spectacular.

![](/img/img_2395.jpg)

![](/img/img_2355.jpg)

We stopped at a roadside stand for banana bread then headed to The Garden of Eden, a tropical botanical garden with hundreds of bamboo palms, nut trees, flowers plants and even a waterfall. Jon was in heaven!

![](/img/img_2345.jpg)

![](/img/img_2347.jpg)

![](/img/img_2351.jpg)

Next on the trip was Haipua’ena Falls, gorgeous waterfall with a sparkling pond below. Some swimmers in the pool but we decided to carry on to the next one. Jenna, Jon and Nikki climbed further up the side to a higher waterfall. Us old folks stayed down below.

![](/img/img_2377.jpg)

Next stop was at Ching’s pond. Sandy, Giles and I swam in the natural fresh water spring. Very cold and refreshing. Some people were cliff jumping into the pond from about 40 feet in front of the waterfall through a small opening between rocks. Crazyeee! Kids chose not to swim as the local residents had put up signs forbidding it.

![](/img/81211094_475816300017477_1595337659041972224_n.jpg)

![](/img/img_2383.jpg)

Next stop Halfway to Hana cafe for hot dogs and delicious tuna salad sandwiches. 

![](/img/img_2385.jpg)

Unfortunately running out of time as we need to be in Ha’iku before 3:30 so drove directly to Nahiku Road, a one lane road that leads to a very small hamlet inhabited by about 17 families. The bridge has been in disrepair for a number of years so had to walk the remainder of the way by foot to the ocean. 

![](/img/img_2405.jpg)

Followed a stream that let to a pond with rope swing and then to the ocean. Unbelievable views of the coast and the pounding surf. 

![](/img/img_2390.jpg)

![](/img/81251311_3141400332751067_3888042243038117888_n.jpg)

Nikki, Jenna, Jon and Sandy found a small waterfall flowing into a small pond just before it fed into the ocean. Jenna went for a quick dip into the cold spring water. Nikki acted as their personal travel guide equipped with the most up to date gear. 

![](/img/82684876_819238258590350_7877751378494357504_n.jpg)

![](/img/81401365_512980386233306_2110874983151435776_n.jpg)

Giles and I had headed back to the car. I commented that this island could do with some monkeys, just as I said that two dark shapes came out from under a parked truck and ran at Giles. Scared the shit out of him. He was startled to see two young puppies at this ankles!

![](/img/img_2407.jpg)

We drove back down the Highway to Hana in a light misty rain. Good thing we had out the top back up on the Jeep! The greens of the tree cover were glistening, very magical looking.

Made it to Ha’iku to pick up the bikes for the sunset summit tomorrow. Awesome shrimp linguine dinner, early to bed. 3:00 am departure tomorrow!

**Friday January 3rd**

As luck would have it, it’s a blustery rainy day, visibility is poor. Made a relatively quick trip to the base of Haleakalā crater. Extremely windy and steep ride up in dense fog. Literally could not see a thing. Doing this at 4:00 a.m.

![](/img/img_2431.jpg)

We had to leave one of the cars and two bikes just before the park entrance. We put on warmer gear and all crammed into the one Jeep for the final ascend to the volcano crest, an elevation of 10,000 feet. It was getting extremely cold in our plastic windowed Jeep and our Hawaii warm weather clothes. Sandy declared “ It’s fucking cold, I can’t see a thing and this is not fun”!

![](/img/img_2427.jpg)

![](/img/img_2426.jpg)

Jenna initially was perched on Jon’s lap, then on Nikki’s lap, and then in the middle console in the front seat. She looked like a perched gargoyle ready to bounce. In all this movement her biking glove was dropped outside the car and got soaked in the rain. We all had a good laugh when Jon realized he had grabbed two right handed gloves. We all stayed in the cramped car until 6:30 at the top of the crater, still not being able to see a thing.

![](/img/img_2415.jpg)

 We then moved into the observation shelter with about 60 other very cold, wet and disappointed others. Nikki was laughing her head off declaring “this is hilarious” and taking funny shots of all of us freezing our asses off.

Well the sunrise come and went with us still in a cloud of clouds. Our pictures look like we are on a snowy mountain.

Giles and Nikki braved the rapid 30 mph descend on their bikes from the crest down to our second vehicle in the pouring rain and amongst leaving vehicles. We met them at the second vehicle soaked and eyes bloodshot from the rain pelting them but grinning from ear to ear. Giles couldn’t feel his fingers and Nikki’s toes were numb but they said it was “the best”.

![](/img/img_2434.jpg)

Jenna and Jon quickly got their bikes ready and the four of them took off down the 22 mile windy hairpin descent. I tried to GoPro some of their ride but not sure I was successful. Many bike groups heading down the road but none that had started at the summit like our group. Jenna was nervous at first but quickly careened down like a pro.

Sandy and I drove the Jeeps back to the rental place in Ha’iku while they cycled there. We passed them at one point with Nikki in crouched position yelling “wooohooo”! They were almost going as fast as the vehicles so arrived at the rental spot shortly after us. Downhill almost all of get way!

Refueled with a java fix in a great coffee spot in Ha’iku. Looking up at the volcano it was still shrouded in clouds, the sunrise was a colossal failure but the bike ride was epic.

Seeking sun we headed south to Po’on? Beach to relax and snorkel. Celebrated the new year, a great trip and the bike ride down the volcano with a bottle of champagne. Rested, swam in the large waves and snorkelled near the lava rocks. Amazing coral and some really large fish. Jenna and Jon saw a turtle!

Tonight went out to dinner at a local restaurant called Kitchen 5315. Great red snapper special and calamari and potato cake apps. We are all really tired from being up at 2:30 am and knowing we need to be up early for our flights home.

We are all sad that we will have to say goodbye to Nikkers tomorrow as we head home and she heads to the big island. We are not sure when we will see her again. So glad that we were able to spend this time together.

**Saturday January 4th**

This is the day of good-byes and endless flights. Once we arrive in Honolulu we have three more connections before we arrive home Sunday at 11:00am.

We were all sad and ready to say good bye to Nikki in Honolulu. She is off to the Big Island until the 20th and then off to New Zealand.

It has been an awesome jam packed adventurous trip. So glad we did it.

 **Highlights include:** family time playing games, swimming, snorkelling with the sea turtles, hiking in the mud, waterfalls and rainbows, the luau, kayaking in the river, north road and Hana highway and cycling down the volcano ( for some).
