# New Orleans

March 16-21, 2023





Thursday March 16



Encountered no issues getting from Toronto to New Orleans, despite being March Break and having to transfer in Washington DC. Arrived to a lively 23 degrees and a long taxi line due to a number of conferences occurring in the city.



Maureen and Greg arrived ahead of us making there way to a local wine bar to have something to eat. We checked into our loft unit on St Claude Ave. Taxi cab was a little concerned with leaving us out front as was the US customs agent at the airport ( who looked up where we were staying and said it “looked sketchy “).



The place is very industrial looking with concrete floors and tall ceilings. Sparse but fine. Giles and I headed out down Touro Street having to pass a large crowd staying outside Ivy’s Bar. We clearly looked and felt a little out of place but once we continued down the street you could clearly see the regentification that is happening in the neighborhood.

We joined Maureen and Greg in the Barrillbaux wine Bar, had a quick bite to eat and sampled the local cocktails ( Sazarac and Old Fashion). Both were loaded so quickly became slightly intoxicated. Caught right up with Maureen and Greg who had been sitting in the bar for awhile.



There was also a guitarist playing familiar tunes. He sounded great!



We headed back to the unit, passing the now surprisingly empty Iggy Bar. Chatted with the bartender who said the crowds often use her place as the warm up bar. We promised to be back, she cautioned us to be careful in this area.



Not heeding that advice we headed to the local convenience store/liquor outlet and picked up bourbon ( Redemption-we liked the name) Jameson and Maker’s Mark. And of course loads of junk food.



Half a bottle later and no chips left we headed to bed.



Friday March 17

Surprisingly we all felt okay this morning. We donned what green clothing we had including beads and bunny ears Maureen brought,and headed out. In search of a good coffee we headed to the Ruby Slipper for brunch. Touro Street looks much different in the light of day-so many cute cottage homes.

Awesome breakfast with St Paddy Day mimosas and Irish coffees. Giles realized he left his credit card in the restaurant last night, will have to lock card and retrieve later. It’s raining heavily so headed back to the unit to wait it out.



We waited and waited but let up it did not, so we ventured out with our umbrellas. We headed to Royal Street to mostly window shop but we did go in a few art galleries and local shops. Lots of festive people wandering the streets dressed in green wigs, beads and Irish leprechaun suits.

We wandered the streets and found Lafitte’s Blacksmith Cottage, the oldest bar in New Orleans. Lots of patrons drinking cocktails and beers in the 300 year old bar. 

![](/img/img_7357.jpg)

We decided to continue to find another drinking spot. We settled on Hermes Bar which is part of Antoine ‘s Restaurant. The bar has beautiful wood panelling and has a history of having a hidden speakeasy room during prohibition. Maureen and I went searching and found the mystery room which is now used for private functions. Drinks were treat, service not so great.



We walked over to Jackson Square, popped into the St Louis Cathedral and then walked down to the river. The great muddy Mississippi seemed high. From there we stopped for the classic cafe au lait and beignets for a break and reenergize for the parade at Cafe De Monde. We timed it right as our wait in line was only a few minutes. As we indulged on the sugar rush the line extended down the street.

Next stop Bourbon Street to take in the craziness. Every bar seems to have live music and people throwing beads from the upper wrought iron balconies. Stopped in the Swig and Swine for a shot of Jameson and a pint of Guinness. The singer sounded great so we stayed for awhile.

![](/img/img_7448.jpg)

Love the fact that we can wander the streets with our drinks. Spent some time in a really nice leather shop. No purchases…yet.



We headed down to Decatur Street to line up for the parade. While we waited Greg and Giles got scammed into a shoe shine by two guys using the line “ I know where you got your shoes”. The boys engaged with them and before we knew it they were shining their shoes and demanding money. Due to a miscommunication between Greg and I (and probably the alcohol haze) instead of getting $5 each they got away with $30. I guess there is a fool born every minute!

The weather has turned cold and wet so we decided to take a window seat facing the parade route in the Corner Oyster House. We tried their grilled oysters-not the best but at least we were inside and have access to bathrooms.



Crowds of people lined the streets to see unadorned trucks, flatbeds hoping to catch the colourful beads being thrown. The young girls at the front easily got beads and kisses. No breasts were flashed that I noticed. A very tall girl in front of us got lots of attention, she generously handed beads and flowers to Maureen and I. Turns out her name was Gracie and the lady she was talking to was named Rosie!

After the parade we headed to Frenchmen St. Quickly ducked into the first bar, Cafe Negril where the band was playing Van Morrison tunes. Giles scurried to the “open “ men’s washroom just in time to get rid of the “grilled oyster “. Didn’t damp his spirits though as we stayed to hear two more bands ( high pitched painting lady and a much better reggae band).

Strolled home and turned in after a quick glass of Jameson.

Saturday March 18

We slept in this morning grabbed coffee from the little shop next door and then walked into the Treme neighborhood. There is still obvious signs of Karina damage with whole houses falling apart and abandoned. However there is also signs of new life being generated and pride of ownership dotted throughout the area. So many cute homes that show such potential.

We went up to St Ann Street and joined the queue for fried chicken at the world famous Willie Mae’s Scotch House. The hour wait was worth it-best fried chicken, cornbread and side dishes (buttered beans, kidney beans and rice, green beans and gravy and candied yams). Good thing we were walking back because we all finished our plates!

![](/img/img_7428.jpg)

![](/img/img_7434.jpg)

Arrived back at our unit in time for an afternoon nap. We are all still full from the fried chicken lunch so we passed in dinner and headed into the French Quarter to the Mahogany Hall Jazz Bar. We lucked into the cozy intimate back lounge where we could hear the band but still chat. Cocktails were yummy and the music great.

![](/img/img_7386.jpg)

From here we walked the now quiet streets and made our way to Frenchmen Street. Lots more people hanging out in front of the numerous live music venues. We popped into a dive to get a slice of greasy pizza and Giles got a very expensive glass of bourbon. We’re just about to give up going into any bar and heading back when we came across the Marigny Bar. Found a table, drinks were cheap and the music sounded great so stayed until closing (which is midnight here).

Sunday March 19

Found a quaint little breakfast spot called Wakin Bacon up on Dumaine and Dauphine in the French quarter. They had great sour dough bread and yummy bacon.

We next headed toward Canal Street to pick up the St Charles trolley, best $1.25 spent to tour the garden district. The tree lined boulevards lined with century old mansions are spectacular.

![](/img/img_7407.jpg)

 Unfortunately Layfette cemetery was closed for renovations so we couldn’t investigate the grave yard. Instead we toured the side streets looking at the beautiful mansions built from plantation money. The architecture and craftsmanship is exquisite, especially the wrought iron gates. At least these homes have continued to be maintained and preserved.

We travelled the length of St Charles by trolley then headed up Royal Street in search of a cocktail bar. We attempted to go to the carousel bar but it was full so we headed to Bourbon Street to Fritzel’s a lively jazz bar. We stayed for two sets. Musicians were amazing and so talented especially the second female singer. Drinks were strong, music was great, had a seat-what more could you want. They also had a really nice hidden back patio which would be lovely in the nice weather ( which we are not experiencing right now!).

Saw my first vampire sighting at this bar, a goth looking guy with what looked like permanent fangs smiled at me when I was on the way to the restrooms.



A number of street performers were out on Bourbon Street, many were quite good. We ended up eating at Curios - yummy blackened redfish and creole dishes. The bread pudding for dessert was unnecessary but delicious.

Wandered back to the unit only to find I have left my glasses somewhere. The hunt will be on tomorrow to find them. Grrrrr



Monday March 20

We got a really late start to the day, not leaving the unit until 11:30. On our way to the French Quarter we stopped into Nonno’s for breakfast. A cute spot run by a former prison inmate.



After breakfast we strolled down Royal Street to do a little shopping. We enjoyed looking at outrageously expensive antiques along this street. An example of the items : cocktail glasses for $400 and an Edwardian medical kit for $4800 -all in US dollars of course!



Sat in sun at the vampire cafe where we sipped mimosas and beers and listened to bad accordion playing. We also patiently waited to see who would hit their head on the low hanging sidewalk sign. We were not disappointed.



Once we were suitably fortified we continued shopping. Maureen picked up some fleur de lise coasters and I picked up some tacky Nolan’s Christmas decorations.



Grabbed a drink to go from Corner Oyster bar -beers and mimosas and headed to enjoy the sun, sitting along the river walk watching the barges and a cruise ship navigate the bend.

![](/img/img_7444.jpg)

Late in the afternoon we headed over to Bourbon Street in search of my glasses . Oh well seeing as we are in Fritzel’s bar and the band sounds good-why not have a drink and stay awhile. This band featured banjo and tuba players. Great sound!

![](/img/img_7450.jpg)

We had dinner at the Court of Two Sisters. Got a little silly ordering “who’d at”s”. Lots of food and drink-no room for dessert this time

![](/img/img_7361.jpg)

In a quest to finish all the booze we partook of a nightcap and headed to bed.



Tuesday March 21

Our little coffee spot wasn’t open this morning so we headed to the airport early in search of that much needed cup of joe. We also grabbed breakfast at the airport. We are all on the flight from New Orleans to Washington. Parted ways in the Washington airport-us heading to Toronto, Greg and Maureen heading to Ottawa.



All agreed best part of the trip was the live music, especially at Fritzel’s Bar. All wished the weather had been warmer.
