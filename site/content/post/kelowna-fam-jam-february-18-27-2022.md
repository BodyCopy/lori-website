**Friday February 18**

The excitement of heading to Kelowna for our family get together quickly turned to dismay, then disappointment when Nikki, Dave, Giles and I missed our flight by three minutes. A combination of mishaps: ice/snow storm the night before, leaving the condo too late, long line-ups at the oversized baggage area and mostly the hour and a half line up to clear customs resulted in us being stranded behind with approximately 50 other travellers from a connecting Montreal flight. Customer service blamed it on security personnel phoning in sick. For the most part we witnessed few "Karens or Kevin’s" blowing gaskets, however one irate couple did throw the f-bomb around for awhile. We managed to secure seats on the same flight for tomorrow morning. I have never seen security so crazy, thousands of domestic and international travellers all being funnelled through one gate. Total shit show. Nothing to do but laugh and go out for breakfast.

Fortunately Sandy, Brendan and Robin made the flight and Jenna and Jon made their West Jet flight. A video call later showed them all settling into the house nestled in the Okanagan valley with the mountains in the background. Sad faces all round!



**Saturday February 19**

Up super early! Arrived before 5:00 a.m. and breezed through security with no line! What a difference a day and an hour makes.

Well the view does not disappoint nor does the variety of activities available at this home. Hard to decide what to do: hot tub, sauna, pool, foosball, pool table, big screen tv’s, poker table…ah... just can’t decide. I guess we will have to do it all.

![](/img/5fc143ba-03a9-4528-ab8f-1ea55308116b.jpg)

![](/img/img_5075.jpg)

Giles and I had a sauna and swim while Jenna and Jon made a salad and spaghetti dinner for all of us. We watched the four man bobsled Olympic run ( Canada won bronze!) but opted not to watch the gold medal hockey game between Russia and Finland. Just doesn’t seem the same when it’s not a match between Canada and the US.

![](/img/img_5073.jpg)

Jenna, Jon, Giles and I played pool. Jenna and I were pretty pathetic, though got better the more we played. The rest played euchre with Sandy winning a grand slam.

**Sunday February 20**

Up at the crack of dawn enjoying our coffee in the hot tub watching the sunrise. Our view overlooks the city lights, the Okanagan River and the mountains in the background.

![](/img/img_5219.jpg)

Today Brendan and Robin headed to SilverStar for a day of skiing. 

![](/img/img_5216.jpg)

The rest of us divided and conquered: Sandy, Giles and I hiked Bear Creek Canyon with Jenna, Jon, Dave and Nikki hiking the same trail in the afternoon.

![](/img/img_5486.jpg)

![](/img/img_5130.jpg)

![](/img/image0000011.jpg)

![](/img/image0000041.jpg)

There were some steep climbs and icy passages but we were rewarded with breathtaking views, a meandering river, waterfalls and steep canyon walls. We even saw large horned mountain sheep on the side of the mountain.

![](/img/img_0297.jpg)

![](/img/img_0304.jpg)

Watched the closing ceremony of the Olympics and then had a great salad and salmon dinner. The billiards tournament continued with the McGugan/Santyr's challenging the Hill's. Despite improving greatly the Hill's were victorious.

![](/img/img_5074.jpg)

![](/img/img_5119.jpg)

Euchre continued with Brendan getting caught cheating by Sandy.

**Monday February 21**

Happy Family Day!

Big day today! Brendan and Robin headed back to SilverStar for a day of skiing. Nikki, Dave and Giles also went to SilverStar to cross country ski. Can’t believe that Dave braved the gondola up the mountain and skied down on his first time on skies. At the bottom he declared he was done with cross country skiing!

![](/img/img_5239.jpg)

![](/img/img_5279.jpg)

The rest of us headed to Knox Mountain, a hiking trail just outside the city of Kelowna. We took the easier path that wound along the coast to Paul’s tomb. We were rewarded with bald eagle sightings along the way.

![](/img/img_5130.jpg)

![](/img/img_5127.jpg)

Hot tub and sauna well used as we attempted to heal our aching limbs.  Steak dinner and then a lazy night playing jackbox collectively on our phones.

\
**Tuesday February 22** 

Everyone’s having a down day today. Brendan and Robin headed to Bear Creek to do the 2km hike through the canyon. 

![](/img/img_5151.jpg)

![](/img/img_5152.jpg)

Giles and Jenna went off to the Telemark Nordic Centre to cross country ski. 

![](/img/img_5517.jpg)

![](/img/img_5522.jpg)

The rest of us spent the day reading.

Jenna continues to challenge everyone to billiards. Giles narrowly beat her but I sense it’s just a matter of time.

![](/img/img_5121.jpg)

This evening Dave and Nikki treated us to an outing at Axe Monkey, Kelowna. We spent a fun filled two hours hurling axes at bulls eye stumps. Eventually everyone got the hang of it. A bulls eye was had by all either using one hand, two handed or the underhand throw. We had the whole place to ourselves so we could change cages and move around to new spots. Good time!

**Wednesday February 23**\
We will call this day “Before” and “After”

***Before:***

Everyone up early for our big day at Big White Ski Resort. Excitement and apprehension as we have some first time downhill skiers in our midst. The drive up to the mountain was beautiful with all the pine trees leaden with snow. 

![](/img/img_5531.jpg)

Arrived early enough that no crowds so we were able to grab rental equipment and lockers with no problem (except Giles' key got stuck in the locker, temporarily trapping his lunch).

We parted company with Brendan and Robin heading to the difficult hills, the newbies heading with Giles to the bunny lift and Sandy and I making our way to the dog sledding hut.

![](/img/img_5202.jpg)

![](/img/img_5205.jpg)

The huskies were a joy to behold. Eager and friendly, howling and enthusiastically greeting us. The owners, Tim and Carrie shared their knowledge about mushing and answered all our many questions. It was so fun to see how excited the dogs were to be harnessed and lined up to go.

![](/img/img_5213.jpg)

We headed down snow covered trails through the pine forest. Serene and peaceful. Amazing to watch how fast the dogs run, each with their own specific gait. Twice on the trail we stopped to let Sandy and I drive the sleds. It is harder than it looks, you stand on the runners and hold on tight. The driver controls the brake as the lead dogs do most of the steering. You lean to the left and right and call out directions to the dogs to help them know which way to go. A great experience!

![](/img/20220223_111636.jpg)

![](/img/img_6864.jpg)

Afterwards Sandy and I headed for the Bullwheel for lunch.

***After:***

Phones started blowing up just as we were seated for lunch announcing that Jon had been taken by ski patrol down the hill to an awaiting ambulance. After moving from the bunny hill the group travelled up the chair lift to a green circle run. Immediately after leaving the chairlift Jon hit an edge, popped his bindings and awkwardly fell, fracturing his leg. In extreme pain the paramedics gave him nitrous( which didn’t actually help as the canister was apparently empty).

Jenna grabbed the car, drove to where she thought they had taken Jon (to the patrol centre at top of mountain) only to be told he was at the bottom of the mountain at another spot. Getting lost and then getting the car stuck on an icy road she finally managed to find them. Jenna and Giles headed down into Kelowna to meet Jon at the hospital. Brendan and Robin were able to assess Jon at the patrol centre and are pretty confident that he has a fracture and possibly will need surgery.

Jon’s Kelowna trip just got extended!

![](/img/img_5244.jpg)

![](/img/img_5247.jpg)

Seeing as we require two cars to return, Sandy and I attempted round two of having lunch at the Bullwheel, Robin and Brendan continued skiing, Dave and Nikki turned in their rental equipment and joined us for drinks. Dave declaring “I’m done with skiiing, this is too dangerous”.  I’m sure hearing Jon scream in agony cemented that sentiment.

Giles returned to the resort in late afternoon with all of us continuing with the scheduled plan of tubing. Due to the cold temperatures the runs were fast. The tube operators were great, assisting with spinning and pushing us down the runs. Giles got some great video of us tethered together flying down the slope.

![](/img/img_5541.jpg)

![](/img/image0000001-1.jpg)

![](/img/img_5535.jpg)

Somber ride back as we got the news that Jon has a moderate fracture that will require surgery (see X-rays). He will have to stay probably a week longer before being cleared to fly.  Recovery will be at least six months in a cast.

Dropped off some food at the hospital for Jenna and Jon. Surgery scheduled for mid day tomorrow. Jon was in good spirits, requesting a sandwich and admitting that “ he didn’t give the mountain the respect that it deserved”!

![](/img/img_5303.jpg)

Rest of the group played beer bong in the pool and then into the hot tub. So glad we have all these wonderful amenities.

\
**Thursday February 24**

Brendan, Robin and Giles headed to SilverStar for a day of skiing. The sun is shining and there is a fresh coat of snow on the ground. 

![](/img/img_5278.jpg)

While waiting to hear when Jon will have his surgery, Sandy and I did the east 2km snowshoe loop at the Telemark Nordic Centre.

![](/img/img_5242.jpg)

![](/img/img_0388.jpg)

Dave and Nikki went as well but did the cross country trails (see never say never…Dave went cross country skiing again!)

![](/img/img_5509.jpg)

Jenna called mid afternoon to say Jon had gone into surgery. Sandy and I picked her up and brought her back. A hot shower, rest and a home cooked lunch helped to restore her. She’ll head back to the hospital once Jon is in recovery. Jenna decided to stay the night at the hospital with Jon.

![](/img/img_5412.jpg)

![](/img/img_5372.jpg)

Dave and Nikki made colossal fajitas for dinner. 

![](/img/image0000001.jpg)

Giles, Sandy and I hit the hot tub while the others played pool and foosball. Giles beat me three times at pool while the others played euchre.

A bit of good news this evening, our current accommodation is not rented immediately after we are scheduled to leave, so the owner has graciously offered to let Jenna, Jon and me stay until Jon can fly next week. It is such a relief to not have to move out of this home which is perfectly set up to handle a wheelchair. The owner is only charging me $200 a night, the equivalent of a cheap hotel here.



**Friday February 25**

Brendan and Robin up early to tackle the Myra Canyon hike. Will be eager to hear all about it as the rest of us plan to do that hike tomorrow.

![](/img/img_5244-1.jpg)

Jenna called mid morning to say Jon had a restless night. She kept him company listening to podcasts and watching some shows. The hospital staff have been excellent, providing an extra bed for Jenna. The physiotherapist says Jon will be able to use both the wheelchair and crutches to get around. They are going to x-ray the leg today to make sure the plates and pins are all where they should be.

Luckily Jenna was able to transfer the Mission Hill wine luncheon to Brendan and Robin. The five of us (Giles, Sandy, Brendan, Robin and I) indulged in a delicious charcuterie, then a two course meal of leek risotto or beef tenderloin stripes then scallops or duck. Each was paired with a white or red wine. Generous servings and all was scrumptious. We topped it off with sticky toffee pudding.

![](/img/img_5293.jpg)

![](/img/img_5289.jpg)

![](/img/img_5292.jpg)

Couldn’t resist the gift shop. We all loved the pinot noir-Prospectus. Decided to send some home as a special treat.

![](/img/img_5297.jpg)

![](/img/img_5564.jpg)

Our day was great but didn’t come close to the adventure that Dave and Nikki experienced. They started the day having a delicious brunch, then a three hour spa experience: body wraps, head massages, an hour long massage and then manicures. Then to top off the day they took a helicopter ride around Kelowna, zipping into the canyons with the mountains flanking them. A true “bachelor” style date. Pretty sure he got the rose!

![](/img/image0000091.jpg)

![](/img/image0000021-1.jpg)

![](/img/image0000031.jpg)

![](/img/image0000071-1.jpg)

After much searching we all went down into Kelowna and picked up Jenna for dinner. Sandy treated the group to cocktails (margaritas, wine and beer) and dinner at Original Joes.

Being tired, some of us retired early: others played beer bong in the pool.

![](/img/img_0321.jpg)

\
**Saturday February 26**

Brendan and Robin headed to SilverStar for their last day of skiing. 

![](/img/img_5304.jpg)

Dave, Nikki, Sandy, Giles and I drove the forest mountain road to Myra Station. This is where the hiking trail starts for the Myra Canyon Old Rail Trail. We walked 4km of windy snow covered single lane track over multiple wooden trestle bridges and through two tunnels. Absolutely beautiful.

![](/img/img_5308.jpg)

![](/img/img_5323.jpg)

![](/img/img_5309.jpg)

Not a loop trail so had to walk back the same way, but the sun was shining and the weather was mild.

![](/img/img_5321.jpg)

![](/img/img_5326.jpg)

![](/img/img_5567.jpg)

On the way back into town we stopped at the hospital to visit Jon and then to take Jenna to the medical supply store to pick up what we need for when Jon is discharged. A bit of a setback today, physio unable to get Jon up and about due to low hemoglobin levels. He has had to have two rounds of blood transfusions. Jenna staying at the hospital again tonight. Unfortunate that she isn’t able to spend the last night with everyone.

Kids played Mario Party on the tv while Sandy, Giles and I played pool. Dave made killer margaritas in an attempt to use up some of our booze. A more subdued evening as our trip comes to an end. Not quite the same without all the crew.

Tonight we recorded our “roses” and “ thorns” of the trip: we all agreed that Jon’s accident is the thorn of the trip but we will let him claim that as his thorn.

**Sandy:**

Rose- dog sledding (also everything else) Hee Hee

Thorn- sore knees

![](/img/img_5085.jpg)

**Brendan:**

Rose- sun, fresh snow and slow glades-Deer Park

Thorn- too short

**Robin:**

Rose- skiing in the sunny glades

Thorn- missing the rest of the crew the first day

![](/img/img_5236.jpg)

**Nikki:**

Thorn- missing the flight, not enough skiing and sucking loads at pool pong

![](/img/image0000051.jpg)

**Dave:**

Rose- brunch, helicopter, spa date day, learning to like cross country skiing, all the homemade dinners

Thorn- missing the flight, learning that I don’t like downhill skiing.

![](/img/image0000081.jpg)

**Lori:**

Rose- being all together, variety of hikes, especially Myra Canyon. Loved the dog sledding and tubing.

Thorn -living in a hospital for a week, dealing with subpar care

![](/img/img_5515.jpg)

**Jon:**

Rose - love my onesie snow suit, 

Thorn - wrecking my knee and having surgery, plane ride home

![](/img/img_0336.jpg)

\
**Sunday February 27**

Dave and Nikki left super early for the airport. Didn’t want to miss the plane though getting stuck at this end would of been better than missing a day at the beginning of the trip. Brendan and Robin left next with Giles and Sandy heading out shortly after.

We switched the car rental into my name and I headed back to the hospital to pick up Jenna. The surgeon hasn’t been in since Friday so we’re pretty sure Jon won’t be discharged today. Jenna and I went shopping at Value Village for extra large sweats and shorts for Jon. I convinced Jenna to come back to house for a rest, shower and something to eat before heading back to the hospital.

I spoke to Tony, the property manager. He indicated that if our stay extends past Thursday he will move us to another rental “mansion” in the city for the same cost. Apparently the owners are in Mexico and are willing to help out. Amazing the generosity of strangers!

A little spooky being here all alone. This house makes a lot of noise at night but can’t beat this view.



**Monday February 28**

Jon has been moved to a new room with a real bed after a night of severe pain. Apparently they cut back on his anti inflammatory drugs which contributed to the pain crisis. Hopefully we will hear more news from the doctors today.

What more could go wrong? Well apparently a lot more. Robin isn’t feeling well and has tested positive for COVID. She’s got body aches and general flu symptoms. Brendan got tested and results have come back negative. The rest of us are feeling okay so far. Thankful this happened at the end of the trip and not the beginning.

Super foggy today. No sign of the mountains. Am cleaning and doing laundry today as I wait to hear from Jenna.

Disappointing to hear that no doctor came to see Jon today and he struggled with pain management many times today. This made it difficult to complete the physiotherapy exercises.

A Netflix night for me. Finished watching Wentworth.



**Tuesday March 1**

Finally Jon’s surgeon made an appearance this morning. Jenna and Jon had a list of questions but unfortunately the surgeon became defensive and basically deflected them. Only after Jenna got upset did action happen. An anesthesiologist arrived and was able to answer Jon’s meds questions and changed the regiment to better manage his pain.

Apparently a social worker will help with flight accommodation letters and the discharge nurse will assist with records and prescriptions. They haven’t seen these people yet so no discharge today, maybe tomorrow.

Another quiet night at the “mansion”. I watched the Raptors win and then finished the Atypical series on Netflix.



**Wednesday March 2**

The crew at home are self isolating with Dave now testing positive. I’ve got a dry cough and probably have it but given the circumstances best not to know.

Jon is being released today. The social worker has been very helpful getting all the necessary forms for release and info for follow up back in Ontario.

Jon is unable to travel in a regular car so I brought the wheelchair to the hospital so he can travel by wheelchair cab. The cab driver was an ass and tried to manhandle Jon by grabbing his leg. Only when Jon got angry at him did he change his tune. Pretty traumatic ride to the house which exhausted Jon’s energy reserves.

Quiet afternoon and evening. Watched some tv which was dominated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

\
**Thursday March 3**

Today is the day we move to the new location. I’m anxious to get out of here. I feel we are becoming a headache to Tony despite his protestation that we are not. He has set us up in a suite attached to a spectacular home near Lake Shannon that his friend owns. It is clearly a multi million dollar home with outstanding views of the mountains. I can see why people move here-great life if you have the money.

The wheelchair ride to this location was much smoother but still taxed Jon’s energy. He spent the remainder of the day in bed, still waiting for that allusive “movement”.

\
**Friday March 4**

Movement happened this morning not without a lot of pain and anxiety. This prompted a mini crisis with Jenna and Jon wanting to postpone the flight tomorrow. They weren’t open to my thoughts but luckily were able to speak to Brendan and Robin who I believe talked them off the ledge.

Financially it is just not feasible to remain and I truly don’t think a day or two is going to make a difference when dealing with the anxiety of this flight.

Long day of watching tv. A little chilly today so didn’t venture out much, only to the drug store.

So looking forward to heading home tomorrow.  Jon moving and sitting in wheelchair more today.

\
**Saturday March 5**

Up early, anxiety’s high waiting for airport wheelchair shuttle, packing everything and cleaning up.

Dropping bags at airport, getting Jon settled, running back to drugstore to drop off medical equipment, filling gas tank, returning rental car and then getting through security-all happened seamlessly and without a hitch. I actually could of been on the direct flight with Jenna and Jon-had enough time. Oh well, a couple of hours to do nothing and not have to worry may be just what I need.
