**Sunday May 12th** 

We arrived mid afternoon from Ottawa. Beautiful sunny day, we decided to drive to Mont Royal prior to checking in. Hiked to the lookout point, viewed the very European chalet then headed to the summit where the large cross is. Nothing to see in the day but is apparently beautiful at night.

Our hotel is in the old section of Montreal, The Marriott tucked down an alley. I am shocked by the amount of construction everywhere. They are relaying the cobble stone streets, unfortunately it looks a mess however the old stone building are exquisite.

We wandered Saint Paul street and along the river before settling on Modavio’s for dinner. They specialize in lamb, which I had, Giles having wild boar. Food was excellent and we were even able to catch a few songs of the jazz duo playing tonight.

Went back to the hotel to watch game 7 of the Raptor/ Philly match. What a game, too close for comfort right down to the last second with Kawhi sinking the basket for a Toronto win!

**Monday May 13th**

Giles up super early for his ISMRI conference. I attempted to sleep in but ended up having coffee with Giles before he left at 7:30 a.m. Watched a little tv, then headed for the breakfast included options in the hotel.

Walked along Notre Dame looking for antique shops. Half way to my destination I remembered that it is Monday and that the shops will be closed. Yup, they were, so window shopped instead. Luckily did not see anything I will have to go back for.

Continued along until I reached Atwater Marche. Building and surrounding canopies full of beautiful flowers looked vaguely familiar. Once I entered the covered part I recognized the delicious looking bakery/bread stall. I have definitely been here before!

Walked along the Lachine Canal, great stroll with lots of informative plaques giving historical perspective on manufacturing. Great 10km walkabout.

Relaxed and read in afternoon then went to Jardin Nelson for dinner. Had a Caesar salad and French onion soup. Got a kick out of watching the elementary school groups goofing around in the Jacques-Cartier Place.

Quiet night watching tv (the bachelorette) as Giles was out late at a Seimen’s reception.

**Tuesday May 14th**

Slept in a bit, had a leisurely breakfast with Giles. He decided to play hooked so we are off to the Museum of Fine Art for the morning.

A bit of a walk in the drizzle. Really enjoyed the Thierry Mugler exhibit of haute couture fashion. Absolutely crazy runway costumes.

The Canadian and Dutch paintings were also great to see. Love the early Quebec winter scenes. Had lunch at Reubens and of course we both had the jumbo smoked meat sandwich!

Still raining, will probably spend rest of day curled up reading my book. Yup, did just that, then we walked along Saint Paul to Prince St. Met Peter, Gail and their son, Andrew for dinner at Le Serpent. Meal was okay- Upscale Italian with an upscale price, though we won’t complain as Peter picked up the tab.

Wandered through old town back to the hotel. Watched Netflix (Fargo).

**Wednesday May 15th**

Walked over to St Catherine’s Street to do a little shopping. Looked a lot but bought nothing. Wandered back to old Montreal.

Had a coffee and cookie at Mandy’s. A very cute shop and then went on the hunt to find my poster shop. Spent a fair bit of time researching and have made a list to show Giles tonight. Would like to purchase some for our loft at cottage.

Dinner with the group at an authentic Chinese restaurant in Chinatown and then off to find a sports bar to watch the raptors. Found one! Great viewing and a good scotch but unfortunately they lost...series not done though.

**Thursday May 16th**

Back to the poster shop, after much debate we decided on three. I think they will be great in the loft. Owner threw in a forth that I had admired. Will add names/details later.

Went to the botanical gardens for afternoon. Absolutely beautiful display of tulips and there endless greenhouses are spectacular.

Tonight we went to the Notre-Dame Basilica of Montreal to see their light show.  It was interesting use of light and sound,  in a remarkable building with amazing stain glass windows.
