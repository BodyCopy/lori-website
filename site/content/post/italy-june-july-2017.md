**Team Italy 2017 (Where’s Greg?!?)**



**Day 1: Saturday, June 17 \~ Amalfi Coast \~ Conca Dei Marini ~ Via Lecini 40:: 29C**

After taking the train to Naples Giuseppe drove us all to Conca Dei Marini along very tight roads \~ life in our hands feeling.Amalfi experienced its first rainfall in 3 months!! Dinner at lovely outdoor restaurant La Bonta del Capo \~ fabulous food and lemoncello spritz.Italy was such a great idea!! (*Shelley)*

Amazing winding car trip from Naples to Amalfi coast.Glad Giuseppe was behind the wheel!Beautiful villa perched on the cliffs of the Napoli coast ~ complete with lemon trees and awesome views.Thank God for Maria, our angel behind the wheel of our taxi from the grocery store.Still many stairs up to the restaurant. *(Giles)*

Lots of yellow houses on the way up an extremely windy, switchbacking route to our lovely villa.We passed many scooters, mopeds, cars & bicyclists (& one donkey) on sketchy hairpin turns. Glad we hired Giuseppe!! 

Hunh!Dropped off at the villa, we started the climb to Casa Azzurra….. The locals were happy to drive us to the local 7-11.The fresh peaches and tomatoes were absolutely above any North American corner store, & we experimented with the liquor… The restaurant next door treated us very well. Lemoncello with prosecco (a lemon spritz) is a new favourite, and the free food that came with it was a lovely surprise. Shelley & Eileen got rained on, which the locals were grateful for. We had a ‘sweet’ waiter and will be back for live music one night. A lovely start to our trip despite severe jet lag! (*Lisa)*

Wonderful food and local drinks and then of course the ‘house’ red wine … 3:30 am … memorable! *(Lori)*

Memorable trip to Amalfi once we met Shelley, Lori & Giles in Rome and then David and Lisa in Naples. Christina met us at the villa and then we made our way to the great grocery store in Conca Dei Marini! Took forever ordering fabulous antipasto items, (had a waiting line behind me as I took a long, long time ordering).Loved it! Love Italy!  *(Eileen)*

The travel logistics came together like clockwork! We found each other in Roma Termini and bought our tickets for the high speed train to Napoli 290+ kmh. Lisa and David were waiting for us at Napoli airport on schedule. Giuseppe the ex-F1 Italian Grand Prix driver delivered us to our breathtaking villa on the Amalfi Coast. Our dinner at the restaurant up the stairs was amazing. Octopus (polpo) and gnocchi with shrimp followed by the world’s best Amarena gelato.  (*Greg)*



**Day 2: Sunday, June 18 : Father’s Day \~ Conca Dei Marini \~ Marina :: 28C**

Welcome to sun-soaked Amalfi coast. Jet-lagged travellers catching some extra rest … then the church bells chimed. Wonderful lunch and down 600 hundred steps to the Marina … *(Giles)*

Chiesa San Pancrazio Martire Tyrrhenian Sea

After the 600 steps down, we were greeted to an amazing petite beach filled with locals. We managed to get Shelley into the water and we all practiced our float in amongst the floating pine needles and floating greenery. Thank god for the Belvedere Hotel where we refueled with lemoncello spritz’. *(Lori)*

Didn’t sleep at all last night but woke up to a beautiful blue sky and gusting winds over the Mediterranean Sea! Our villa has a lovely deck overlooking the sea. As well, I found some plum trees where I was able to pick quite a few for the group to enjoy. Walking down to the Conca Dei Marini was “bien special” but thankfully we made a pit stop for a ristorante drink on the patio of Hotel Belvedere. Awaiting a delicious pasta dinner by David & Lisa. Yum! Yum!  (*Eileen)*

A perfect slow start to a jet lagged day … We scrounged brekkie from food from the ‘corner store’ and put together lunch; beautiful cold cuts to fortify us for the walk down, down, down to the beach. Salty sea swim saved my soul! On the way back up, lemoncello spritz and then pasta back at the casa. I’m going to start collecting ‘drift’ ceramics ~ washed up redware between the rocks on the beach.There are some pieces at the ‘casa’ down where the lemon /apricot trees are between the dill & fennel. Yum. Loving the ceramics, hand painted majolica. Enjoying the church bells once per hour, with an extra ‘bong’ for the half hour.  *(Lisa)*

277 steps from Via Lecina vs. 300 from Hotel Belvedere to the Beach (plus a few extras). Enjoyed sun & swimming; yes I did say swimming ~ whooda thunk it!! No pics but lots of great memories & a Dance Party!!  Jxoxo  (*Shelley)*

It rained for the first time in 3 months just as we arrived but we made the best of it and bought beer, wine & groceries. Eileen went foraging for plums on our property. It was Father’s Day & I had to climb 42 (f\*\**ing) floors today!! (*Greg)* 



**Day 3: Monday, June 19 ~ Amalfi :: 31C**

We hit the road at 11:00 am and caught the bus at The Belvedere Hotel to Amalfi. Another sweaty, hair-raising trip through the mountains (see hand-cam, yikes!!) Amalfi was full of tourists and \~ surprise \~ more stairs! But the ‘Carta de’Ingresso’ Cathedral and crypt was definitely worth the visit. I loved seeing the carved marks in the frescoes. Lunch was overpriced and I don’t think I got what I ordered. They do gouge the tourists, but despite that we picked up some beautiful mozzarella cheese for cheap and managed to make it home with only one bus accident. The climb up from The Belvedere was brutal! Forget the Stairmaster, try the Amalfi Coast! Buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes & basil with lemoncello spritz made a lovely dinner … (*Lisa)*

Woke this morning early and decided to read on the terrace. Suddenly a helicopter ‘appeared’ just off our patio. So close, I waved to the driver and passengers. The noise was so loud, had Eileen emerging from her room to watch as well. Before everyone else got up the helicopter dropped off twice at the “H” pad by the church. Wonder who those people were? Could’ve used that helicopter later in day when I was “beaten” by the f\*\**ing stairs!  *(Lori)*

A new friend arrived today, a tabby cat we named “Hercules”. Got right up into Shelley’s grille! He needs food but we are afraid to feed him or he may never leave \~ turns out he still stayed \~ maybe he will eat the ants … (*Giles)*

The Amalfi coastline is so picturesque. Eileen and Lisa’s pictures have captured what is so hard to describe in a few words. Still seems surreal to be in what feels like another world.  (*Shelley)*



**Day 4: Tuesday, June 20 ~ Capo di Conca:: 29C**

Hot, Hot, Hot African winds blowing (“AFFA”). A good day to go to the beach Capo di Conca. A long way down and spectacular *cool* waters ~ very refreshing.  *(Giles)*

This time we took another way down and went swimming in lovely Mediterranean water at the beach restaurant, bar and swimming hole Capo di Conca. Panini sandwiches and local beer, yum! I saw a grey fish with a black spot on its tail and heard that crunchy coral under-water sound. Lots of pretty young Italians, with women in gold bikinis and men in speedos & tattoos of writing I couldn’t read. Back up to the villa and then to the restaurant from Day One, for more octopus, a divine pizza, topped with gelato and lemoncello. Grotto tomorrow and more restaurant time with music and a van ride too!  (*Lisa)*

Loved the cool refreshing water for swimming today ~ crystal clear. Low key evening relaxing at the restaurant drinking local wine. Should’ve listened to Alfredo … Alfonzo … no, Antonio! as the second bottle of wine was much better than the first. Definitely appreciated the complimentary ride down the mountain. Two cats today.  (*Lori)*

Love relaxing at Capo di Conca ~ everyone should live this life! Hard to beat.  (*Shelley)*

\
**Day 5: Wednesday, June 21 ~ Grotta dello Smeraldo & Positano:: 31C**

Positano and the Grotto \~\~ we walked to the Belvedere and took a different route. David took a tumble and bloodied his knees, but the Grotto was a lot of fun. After we visited an extremely overpriced ceramic studio we crossed the street and took the elevator down into stalactites & stalagmites. A tour guide/ row boater with a sense of humour took us into the watery cavern. The water had a special glow from an outdoor sun source and we got to “lookee, lookee” at the miracle, a doll representing Baby Jesus put under the water, eek. After leaving the humidity and rock like melted wax, Eileen bought us lovely figs and cherries to fuel us on for the next leg of our day to Positano. This town had more charm than Amalfi ~ I had a nice chat with a ceramic artist & enjoyed a lemon ice and more great food at a restaurant with orange trees in the courtyard. A dessert called ‘ugly but good’ that David topped with a “careful what you say about my wife”. Italians seem to share David’s sense of humour. Then we managed to catch a bus back, another beautiful day in Italy. We got home in time to catch the ride to our local restaurant where a local crooner was entertaining. With lots of audience participation & lemoncello, we had a great meal and said goodbye to Antonio before getting a ride back to the traffic light. Goodnight Amalfi Coast. (*Lisa)*

Leaving the grotto by SITA bus lead to an impasse at the tunnel \~ ‘the battle of the buses’. Back and forth until our bus was free. Sitting by a Trump supporter did not make the trip go faster. Beautiful Positano. I saw a beautiful sailboat \~ lifestyle of the rich and famous ~ this is the life!!  (*Giles)*

Oh “looky, looky” … today was a day of sights. Beautiful coastline, crazy bus curves and beautiful over-priced pottery. Really enjoyed Positano and the cobbled streets. We went up to our ‘usual’ restaurant for live music. Ended up being one singer with piped in backups. It was still fun. Beautiful sunset. Great food, wonderful company, (despite the bachelorette party beside us).Thank god for the drive to and from the restaurant ~ gotta love this service.  *(Lori)*



**Day 6: Thursday, June 22 ~ Herculaneum & Pompeii :: 31C**

Pompeii & Herculaneum Day \~ Hot Stuff!!  Driven by Mikael to Naples. Ancient civilization uncovered following volcanic eruption (Mount Vesuvius). Time capsule of life in Roman times \~ 70AD!!  The fugitives trying to escape in boats, beautiful villas buried in ash. Statues and mosaics of life in a thriving city (Pompeii) and summer resort (Herculaneum).  Lunch at the mall ~ an extra ‘seconds’ course fill us up with fish.  Sausage on the BBQ and an early night.  zZzZzZ.  *(Giles)*

Mikael drove us to Herculaneum & Pompeii ~ we ate lunch in a mall and had a sausage dinner.  *(Lisa)*



**Day 7: Friday, June 23 ~ Capo di Conca :: 32C**

We say goodbye to Shelley (for now).  She is off to hobnob with the socialites of Rome and attend the wedding of Morgan.  We return to the Lido Capo di Conca beach.  The young guns of Amalfi smokin’ weed and lovers entwined on the patio chairs.  Cool water of the coast and a Jeep ride back up to the top.  Ate a yummy steak dinner.  Thanks to Eileen & Greg for climbing the ‘ladder’ of stairs to the butcher shop.  The cat (Hercules) especially enjoyed the leftovers.  *(Giles)*

Shelley left; we went to the Lido beach and saw MJ smokers.  Eileen & Greg went to the butcher and we cooked steaks ~ fed the cat.  *(Lisa)*



**Day 8: Saturday, June 24 \~ Naples (29C) to Domus de Maria, Cagliari, Sardinia \~ Villa Lentischi :: 36C**

Time to leave for Sardinia today, but not before we check out the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli.  *(Giles)*

Giuseppe drove us to the Naples Museo; we caught a flight to Sardinia, rented cars; drove to Domus de Maria. Pizzaria, Ichnusa and swimming in the pool.  *(Lisa)*



**Day 9: Sunday, June 25 \~ Domus de Maria \~ Nora:: 38C**

Bought fish, went to Nora, saw the Phoenician ruins, so hot. The tower!  Went home, swam, fish stew & frogs!  *(Lisa)*



**Day 10: Monday, June 26 ~ Chia:: 34C**

Picked up kabobs. Went to beach in Chia. Towels!  Used house umbrellas, etc. Snack in Teulada, coffee; bought sandwiches and grilled our own paninis. Went to Mesa winery.  Came back the inland road. Saw a brush fire on the way home. Had kabobs. Naked swimming.  *(?)*



**Day 11: Tuesday, June 27 ~ Isla Sant’ Antioco:: 36C**

Left for Isla Sant’ Antioco.  Took inland road again.  Town of Sant’ Antioco had a very nice tree covered market street.  Saw the roman fountain and bridge.  Giles liked the sailboats in Calasetta. Brought picnic lunch to the beach (burning hot). Left island then went to Tuerredda beach with green water.  Home again. Went for dinner at Bithia, David & Lisa left before the main.Ink pasta was fun! Home for swimming.  *(Lisa)*



**Day 12: Wednesday, June 28 ~ Cagliari :: 35C**

Drove to Cagliari. Visited the fish market \~ saw the live fish! Picked up Shelley.  Lisa bought a white dress! Saw the Roman amphitheatre, portcullis. Drinks on the patio. Walked to the marina \~ “Selfie Girls”. “Seabass or Bream”??  Drive home ~ GPS to the bridge to nowhere. Detours.  *(Giles)*

Dinner at Trattoria del Porto Cagliari, a small, non-descript restaurant at the marina which had fabulous food.  *(Shelley)*



**Day 13: Thursday, June 29 \~ Santadi \~ Mountain Meana: Grotto ‘Is Zuddas’:: 35C**

David & Giles hiked the Chia Dunes. David & Lisa took the day off. The rest went to nice Chia beach. Dinner at Trattoria da Angelo. Greg loves fish platters! ~ Zuppa ? Delicious and cheap house wine.

**Day 15: Saturday, July 1st \~ Canada Day! Cagliari (29C) to Florence (28C) \~ Tinto : Greve in Chianti**

Canada Day!! T-shirts. Lisa pockets the keys. Headed to Cagliari airport.  Giles tank not topped!! Down 5L \~ rushed to fill rather than pay 73E. Only took 3.8L!!  Stressful drive to Iglesias.  Flight to Rome /Florence. Nuns on the bus. Picked up cars \~ mini fiasco. Drove to San Stefano ~ scenic route. Gas leak or sewer??  (*Giles)*

Gregario Andretti drives to Volterra.  Etruscan museum, roman amphitheatre.  Afternoon in San Gimignano. Parking coincidences.  Big Tower tour.  *(Giles)*

Volterra is an amazing walled mountaintop town in Tuscany \~ movies have filmed along the scenic roadways. For such a small village the shopping was amazing!!  Fabula Etrusca is true to its title \~ fabulous Etruscan figurines and handcrafted jewellery (which some of us brought home). SP Shoes was an amazing little store tucked away where each of the girls found some unique footwear … Lisa even wore her red shoes home from the store!!  Fantastic skyline to be found from the top of Torre Grossa ~ one of 14 remaining Towers found in San Gimmy (easier to say than its tongue twister but not appreciated by our Italian delegate Eileen).  *(Shelley)*



**Day 18: Tuesday, July 4th \~ Cinque Terre (31C)\~ Florence :: (34C)**

Road trip to Cinque Terre for Eileen, Greg & Shelley. We passed the Carrara mountains where the sculpture marble is quarried and drove through La Spezia \~ Naval Base. Tried to park at the 1st village Riomaggiore, found a small spot which was quite high and far removed from the port; so we drove on to the 2nd village Manarola.  Walked down through the village centre \~ along the roadway we saw Ferrari’s and there were boats parked alongside some shops \~ quite a distance from the water!  Reached Nativity square with stained glass figurines. There were cliff divers close to the boats docking in the marina. We took the ferry along the coast, passing the beautiful quaint Corniglia which is only accessible via the train which runs from La Spezia to Genoa through the mountain base and stops at each of the 5 villages. The ferry pulled into Vernazzo, although it was beautiful we stayed onboard to the final village Monterrosso al Mare. We wandered the village hoping for lunch, however, once again \~ our timing was a little off and it was local siesta for most establishments. We found the awesome Ristorante Ciak which turned out to be highly rated spot for fish & pasta ~ with a nautical theme, skiff hanging from the ceiling and very cool basement wine cellar we could view underglass. We enjoyed a quiet sunset and peaceful ambience having light dinner at home with some Reserva Drugo from our local Santo Sefano winery up the lane from the villa. *(Shelley)*

We got to Florence bright and early, in time for free parking at Piazza de Michelangelo!!  Saw the Duomo down below and cried! After a long trek down, we headed for the Duomo (which got larger and larger); beating the monster crowds to the Baptistry doors. Line ups to the Cathedral already stretched around the massive white building. After coffee & croissants, (the covered food market didn’t have any), we made it to the Church of Ascension in time for a service. With hardly any indication of a church on the outside, the elaborate baroque interior was fantastic. In the same square was the Museum of Innocents (Romanesque arches by Filippo Brunelleschi). The story of the orphanage & objects was unforgettable. We saw David and the prisoners and plaster busts (with 1,000 tourists); went back to the Museum of Innocents for lunch. Expensive but with beautiful views of Florence. We finished the Museum and walked around Florence, sitting at the Piazza della Signoria with all the Sabine Women and a copy of David & Hercules. Ponte Vecchio was full of jewellers; David & Lisa wandered to a sketchy part of the town near the wall & drank Becks while Lori & Giles were overwhelmed with paintings at the Pitti Palace. We met at Piazzale Michelangelo, drove back to Greve in Chianti and had dinner in Piazza Matteotti accompanied by live opera!  *(Lisa)*



**Day 19: Wednesday, July 5th \~ Greve in Chianti \~ “Day Off” :: (35C)**

Some early morning swimmers in the pool, slow start to the day. Santyr’s, Boyd’s and SB decided to tour some wineries. Our first stop was at Castello Querceto ~ which was closed for lunch (go figure!) so we walked through the beautifully manicured gardens with fishponds and beautiful albino and colourful peacocks with babies. Sped off to Castello Di Verrazzano for our planned 3pm tour. Had a *very* quick snack \~ staff was wonderful, served us extremely quickly and then packaged the remaining food to go. Eileen commended their amazing charcuterie platters as the best ever in all their visits to Italy. Our tour guide Marco loves Canadians; his girlfriend studied in Montreal.  We toured beautiful gardens and saw some wild boar in the treed forest beside the main home.  We met the winery owner \~ a very nice man who is friendly with the owner of Santo Stefano \~ our Villa vineyard; but both of them are enemies with the vineyard across the field over the border in Siena. Local Tuscan legend tells the tale of two roosters being set off from each of the villages at sunrise and where they met would determine the boundary. The Tuscan rooster was not provided with a dinner and because it was starving it ran faster and farther, thereby giving Tuscany the advantage. Fathers are to buy a bottle of Chianti upon the birth of a child. Cavalier Cappellini saved thousands of bottles of wine for the birth of his son Luigi in 1962. Luigi Giovanni, has added to this amazing personal wine collection with two cellars full for his daughters. They have an amazing balsamic cream which is aged for over 10 years \~ 48E a bottle.Lori indulge in one \~ Giles is not allowed to pour over ice cream; or use at all. It will be enjoyed sparingly. Met a young couple from Montreal, Shelby & Viriander \~ who got lost on their way to Verrazzano and ended up at Santo Stefano ~ meeting David & Lisa!!  Our third winery visit was a much smaller vineyard, Farmhouse Corte Di Valle. Yummy Zafferano cookies and Vin Santo (Giles & Greg’s new fave); and much less expensive than larger wineries.  A late afternoon visit to the pool for a quick swim & cocktails.  David cooked a fabulous chicken dinner with fresh pasta and salad.  *(Shelley)*



**Day 20: Thursday, July 6th ~ Siena :: (35C)**

Arrived and parked at the Siena train station \~ but no escalator (!) So we cabbed it to the Piazza del Duomo. Practically first in line to climb the Facciatone tower and get a beautiful view of the city.  Viewed the Cathedral with intricate mosaics, frescoes and carvings everywhere \~ over the top and grotesquely beautiful. The Baptistery and then down to the Crypt, uncovered in 2000 revealing the foundations \~ so much weight to bear the pillars of the earth …Lunch in the square where the horses race around it to determine the winning neighbourhoods. The Palio di Siena took place on July 2nd. Some of us went to the Botanical Gardens \~ very disappointing \~ “where plants go to die”.  Shopping and excellent gelato.  Monteriggioni on the way home \~ a medieval festival, puppets and strange staircases.  The aperol spritz was noteworthy.  Leftovers for dinner ….. zZzZzz   *(Giles)*



**Day 21: Friday, July 7th \~ San Donato in Poggio \~ Greve in Chianti :: (35C)**

Giles, Greg and David hiked up past Santo Stefano winery and up to a picturesque villa. Found lots of broken tiles/ pottery shards for Lori’s mosaic (to be made at cottage).The pool offered cool relief to the returning hikers.  *(Giles)*

The ladies went off to find a Friday Market. In San Donato we found a *very* small market in the square and asked a young local for the Post Office in order to return the pocketed keys from Cagliari. Tried finding the Post Office by walking without success. Hopped in the car; ended up circling the village and re-entering from the other side; only to find ourselves around the corner from our initial parking spot. We again tried walking only to find we had been one house away from the post office, while rerouting ourselves out of the village. Went to find another market in (Tavasterevalle /TavarnelleVal di Pesa??).  Although a bigger village, the market was only one fruit and veggie stand. Kept seeing signs for a village named Sambuca!  Drove round the beautiful castle winery wall of Badia a Passignano. Me up with the rest of the gang and we all returned to Castello Di Verrazzano for a spectacular Florentine steak with Chianti Classico Riserva, Grappa, Cantucci con Vin Santo.  Back for a swim in the pool, a few cocktails and our last spectacular Tuscan sunset.  (*Shelley)*



**Day 22: Saturday, July 8th \~ Florence (36C) \~ Rome (35C)**

Unfortunately, our last day of travels as Team Italy 2017.  We travelled together into Florence, taking crazy back lanes in and around the train station. Lori, Giles & Shelley departing by high speed rail (260 k/hr!!) to Rome; David & Lisa off to Amsterdam; Greg & Eileen spending one last day in Florence.

As Giles had never been to Rome, our trip was a whirlwind walking excursion to all the main tourist spots \~ Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon; Piazza Navona \~ for the most expensive Aperol Spritz imaginable ~ although it was very tasty! Then we headed over past Piazza Venezia for a walk-by of Colosseum on our way across the Ponte Palatino to Trastevere for dinner.
