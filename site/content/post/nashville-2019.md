**Wednesday October 30th**

Arrived mid morning after a quick flight, however not uneventful, Giles forgot his laptop at customs and didn’t realize it until we were on the plane. Unbelievably they delivered it right to his seat prior to takeoff. Very impressive!

We couldn’t check into our condo til 3 so spent the afternoon having lunch at Acme Feed Co. Had true BBQ and roasted corn. No live music though so wandered over to the Music Hall of Fame hoping to spend a few hours at the museum however they did not have lockers for our luggage so couldn’t get in.

Well that left walking over to BB Kings and partaking of their happy hour specials and listening to some live music. Great way too while away the afternoon.

Our condo is perfectly located on 2nd Ave in the heart of downtown. Very close to Printers Alley and Broadway. Went to Skull’s for dinner. Awesome meal of grilled Veal porterhouse steak and prime rib. Should of shared one entree as the portions are huge. Great jazz playing as we ate. From there wandered down Broadway listening outside all the honky tonk bars. Mix of country and rock.

Settled on a singer , Ceylon May at Doc Hollidays. Great voice!

Weather: mixed, showers, around 13 degrees

**Thursday October 31st**

Spent the morning hanging out in my awesome condo/loft reading waiting for Giles to return from his poster presentation.

We went walking in the cold rainy weather to the Hermitage Hotel to have swanky cocktails at the Oak Bar. Giles had a flight of Jefferson bourbons and I had a Manhattan. Lovely bar and the “gentleman’s bathroom isn’t too shabby either. Classic Art Deco design used many times in movies and apparently was a secret rendezvous location for politicians in the day to make backdoor deals.

Stopped in at BB King’s to listen to some blues and have a drink prior to dinner. Great that it is steps from our condo!

Met with Laura and Steven for dinner at the Makeready. Great quiet location so we could chat. Afterwards we strolled Broadway Ave. Laura and Steven left soon afterwards, we braved the Halloween parties and spent a few hours in Kid Rock’s bar being totally entertained by the band and the patrons. Great evening !

Weather: cold, rainy and about 5 degrees

**Friday November 1st**

What a great day! Sun is shining and we are off to explore the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum as well as RCA Studio B. The studio was really quite magical. Preserved time capsule of the 50’s to present day recording studio where Elvis and others created hundreds of amazing songs.

The museum was a little heavy on the country for us but they did have a few special exhibits that held some surprises. Such as Willie Nelson’s and Waylon Jennings rise to fame out of Austin Texas instead of Nashville as the Outlaws.

Another exhibit highlighted The Bryant’s career as songwriters. Who knew they were behind so many great songs!

Satisfied my craving for hot fried chicken. Went to The Stillery on 2nd for a great lunch.

Rested up at the condo for awhile before heading out for a night of music.

Strolled along Broadway and stopped into Nudies and then Crossroads for awhile. Both playing countryish rock so continued on. From the street we were drawn in to Redneck Reviera after hearing an amazing female voice. Stayed for a couple of hours listening to Natalie Brady & The Nite Owls. A true rising star, one to watch out for.

At 10:00 on we headed up to Printers Alley into Bourbon Street Blues Bar to hear The Sweet Lizzy Project. Lucked into fabulous front row seats and stayed for the amazing vocals.

Perfect day!

**Saturday November 2nd**

Slept in a little but were woken up to hundreds of voices walking in a breast cancer marathon outside our place. Then hours later thousands of motorcycles paraded down the street for some undetermined cause. The sound was deafening but exciting to see.

While Giles was at the conference I walked down Broadway to the Frist Art Gallery. Went to the Eric Carle exhibit showcasing 50years of his children’s art/literature.

While in the gallery stumbled upon a very moving exhibit of female indigenous art from across North America. Exquisite examples of bead work, painting, and pottery.

Met Giles in front of gallery. Walked over to The Gulch area and had lunch at Biscuit Love.

Walked around but really not much to see so went to see the stain glass windows at Union Station Hotel. Beautiful renovated Victorian train station, an amazing lobby.

Dropped into BB Kings for a quick drink and to listen to some blues then off to the reception at the Music City Centre. We had a good meal and even danced for awhile to the live band music. Music was very disco/popish so left early and headed to Broadway to find better music.

Despite being over dressed we popped into Doc Holliday’s for a nightcap. Unfortunately the music wasn’t that great so headed home after a bit.

**Saturday November 3rd**

Beautiful sunny day-too bad we have to leave. Uneventful trip home.
