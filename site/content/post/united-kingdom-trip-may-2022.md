**Friday May 6, 2022 -London**

Well after a couple of years of COVID restrictions and being travel shy, we are heading to the UK. Giles has a conference in London so our trip will start there.

We heard rumours of massive lines at the airport and people standing in line for hours to pass through customs. After our missed flight to Kelowna we arrived five hours early and sailed through security- figures!

Had plenty of time to share a meal and hurry up to wait. Flight was painful-full plane, hot food served when we should have been sleeping, being masked entire time and unable to sleep but…we are here!

Bit grumpy and getting lost doesn’t help-not to mention we panicked thinking we had been scammed when we couldn’t find the lock box for the rental unit. All worked out in the end. We are on a lovely lively street beside Waterloo station, perfectly situated by the London Eye, Westminister Abbey and Big Ben. Strolled the riverfront and found a great Asian Fusion Restaurant called Wagamama. Polished off a bottle of wine and ate some fantastic tapas.

There is a very cool graffiti underground tunnel called The Vaults at Leake Street. Artists spray paint the walls and ceilings. No rules so everyday there is a new collection of paintings. Unfortunately my pictures don’t do it justice. Skate boarders also use the alleyway as their stunt playground as well. There are some underground bars here that look sketchy but interesting.

Very jet lagged so turned in early.

**Saturday May 7**

We both fell into a deep sleep only to be wide awake at midnight. Spent a few hours listening to the trains rumble, laughter from the bar below and typical city sounds. We eventually fell back asleep.

![](/img/img_5660.jpg)

Today we are off to Portobello Road Market, specializing in antique stalls and food vendors. Arrived early so we could beat the crowds but the street soon filled up with trinket seekers.  Giles bought a belt and I went on a hunt for silver. I found a number of very ornate serving pieces.

![](/img/img_5661.jpg)

We picked up fresh samosas and sweets for dessert. On the way back to the tube we stopped at a tea and scone shop and had our first (of many, no doubt) scones, clotted cream and jam tea.

![](/img/img_5662.jpg)

![](/img/img_5666.jpg)

Gotta love the underground tube, it’s a maze of tracks zipping everywhere under the city.

After dropping off our purchases and changing our footwear, we headed to The Queen’s Walk.

![](/img/img_5700.jpg)

This path follows the river with beautiful lanterns and restaurants/bars with great views of the many bridges spanning the river. We stopped at one to have a late afternoon cocktail.

![](/img/img_5686.jpg)

Travelled through the vaults to see the new graffiti on our way back to the flat. Works in progress, will take some photos over the days to see progression.

![](/img/img_5672.jpg)

![](/img/img_5673.jpg)

Simple meal tonight of salad and samosas and watched a movie -Prisioners.

Good day of shopping and walking (13 k).

**Sunday May 8**

Mother’s Day today. Giles surprised me with coffee in bed, a sweet card and a printer’s block embossed with the letter "L " that he picked up yesterday at the Portobello Market.

Using our maps and guide book we headed out on a self guided “Royal City” walk. Went to Queen Victoria’s Tower Garden which runs alongside the Parliament Building, the old Westminister Jewel Tower, past Westminister Abbey to St James Park.

![](/img/img_5674.jpg)

![](/img/img_5675.jpg)

![](/img/img_5676.jpg)

Happened upon the changing of the guard and a small military band parade. It is surprising the number of barricades, and restrictions now around the Royal palaces and government buildings. You used to be able to get close but not anymore. There was a time that the police only carried batons, now they have assault rifles.

![](/img/img_5679.jpg)

Wandered Pall Mall and went into Fortnum and Mason, the oldest (300 years) grocery store. Beautiful displays and staff personnel wandering around in red tuxedos. Everything was exceptionally expensive. We looked but didn’t buy.

Found a great cafe to purchase sandwiches and a treat. Sat in Leicester Square to eat lunch and listen to the buskers.

![](/img/img_5684.jpg)

![](/img/img_5682.jpg)

Continued to wander the streets to Trafalgar Square and then spent a few hours in the National Art Gallery. They have an excellent collection of Monet, Van Gogh, Renoir and Seuret and Cezanne.

![](/img/img_5685.jpg)

Quenched our thirst in the Gordon’s Wine Bar and partook of a great pate charcuterie board.

Strolled along the Victoria Embankment, a beautiful park running along the Thames.

![](/img/img_5677.jpg)

Came back to the flat for a rest. Had a great Mother’s Day video chat with all the kids. Sandy even chimed in and we were able to briefly see Brodie.

Went down to the All Bar One for a quick dinner and then back to the flat.

**Monday May 9**

Giles is off to his conference in the Canary Wharf District and I’m going to spend the day wandering around Covent Garden Market. The antique market is held here on Mondays. I’m hoping to find some treasures.

![](/img/img_5693.jpg)

Beautiful warm sunny day. I lucked into a few vendors who sell silver. I picked out a few spoons, knives, forks and found an asparagus server from the “Ritz”.  Wandered through the cobbled streets of Covent. 

![](/img/img_5692.jpg)

Stopped for lunch in a quaint bakery, sitting outside soaking up the sun. Pidgeons were a little annoying but also amusing.

![](/img/img_5695.jpg)

I tried to find an antique bookseller along Long Acres Street. No such luck, that’s what happens when you use an outdated guidebook. Did find a few second hand book stores on Charing Cross Road but their children’s book section was very small and picked over.

Feet are beginning to hurt so stopped off at Leicester Square. Deciding if I should pick up a theatre ticket for tonight at the half price ticket booth.

![](/img/img_5698.jpg)

Decided against it, headed back to the flat, had an easy dinner of left over samosas and watched some bad tv. Wifi is pretty non existent and tv channels are basic.

**Tuesday May 10**

Up early partially because the bed is rock hard and very uncomfortable. Meeting Giles at noon so am spending the morning at the Tate Modern Art Gallery. They have converted an old turbine plant by the Thames into a gallery, housing contemporary and impressionist artists.

![](/img/img_5705.jpg)

The parts of the gallery that are free house mostly contemporary art. Saw three exhibits that were particularly memorable: a tall antique wooden cabinet full of treasures that the artist has found on the banks of the Thames; photographs of racism and despair in South Africa; a photographic exhibit showing 350 buildings in Manhattan that are owned by a real estate company with criminal ties. Exhibit was from the 70’s showcasing the wealth in the millions back then-hard to imagine how much they would be worth now. Can’t help but wonder if the Trump family was part of these real estate holdings.

Met Giles at St Paul’s Cathedral. We toured the nave and dome sections of the church then climbed the dome stairs to the very top. Lots of stone and rod iron circle stairs and narrow passageways to the top. A total of 528 stairs (85 meters)to beautiful views of the city. Out of breath but worth the climb. Then we descended into the crypt that houses many famous people, with most being from the British navel days.

![](/img/img_5709.jpg)

![](/img/img_5719.jpg)

To rehydrate we stopped a small French bakery (Paul’s) and had coffees and sweets.

We continued walking east to Leadenhall a Victorian arcade of stores under a steel and glass enclosure. This is where they filmed the Harry Potter, Diagon Alley scenes. Stopped in a high end scotch/gin and wine shop and determined we definitely over pay for booze.

![](/img/img_5720.jpg)

Carried on to a small Roman church called All Hallows’ Church. The crypt in this church much more interesting than St Paul’s -and it is free!

Viewed the London Tower and the Tower Bridge from afar. Instead of walking back we jumped on the river boat which gave us a quick tour back down the Thames, disembarking at the London Eye.

![](/img/img_5728.jpg)

Short break at the flat and then off again along Union Street on the south bank to Borough High Street. Made our way to the George Inn, famous for being the only standing stagecoach inn from 1676. Apparently frequented by Shakespeare and Dickens. Very crowded in the cobblestone courtyard with the after work crowd. Managed to snag a table in the main building under the stairwell beside the “Harry Potter” sized door under the stairs. Great old wooden floors and wood panelling on floor. Very cozy feel, surrounded by low beamed ceiling. Shared a steak and ale pie and salad and topped it off with sticky toffee pudding.

![](/img/img_5732.jpg)

We wandered back to the flat only getting turned around once, strolled along the water and then headed back. Early night, knees sore after that climb up the dome.

**Wednesday May 11**

After walking 30 km yesterday, I’m getting a late start today. Giles off to his conference so I’m going to go antiquing. Heading to Gray’s antiques, hoping to find some treasures.

![](/img/img_5737.jpg)

Well Gray’s was a bust, most of the stalls were closed and even if open all small items, mostly jewelry.  I walked along Oxford Street and went into Selridges, briefly! Thought about trying on some bras but didn’t feel like it.

Jumped on the tube down to Green Park and walked through the park to St James Park. Sat for awhile by the duck pond but then headed back toward the flat when the rain started.

![](/img/img_5744.jpg)

Wet day and suffering from sore knees so grabbed some Cajun street food and headed back.

Watched a Beatles documentary on tv. They sure love their musicians here.

**Thursday May 12**

Giles and I had a great breakfast at Balance, a restaurant on Lower Marsh Road. We then travelled by tube and the dock lands light rail to Greenwich Village. They have a covered market from the 1700’s that I was hoping would be good. Unfortunately just trinkets but seeing the Cutty Sark tall ship was pretty cool.

![](/img/img_5658-1.jpg)

We parted ways, Giles going to the conference and I headed to Camden Market. What a great market, lots of food stalls, vintage clothing spots all housed in an old stable building and warehouse. Didn’t buy anything but enjoyed looking.

![](/img/img_5761.jpg)

Walked down the canal which has a number of houseboats along it. They call it little Venice. Very pretty.

![](/img/img_5755.jpg)

Giles met me at the Amy Winehouse bronze statue and we partook in a late afternoon cocktail on a terrace overlooking the canal.

![](/img/img_5660-1.jpg)

![](/img/img_5664.jpg)

We then headed to The Blues Kitchen to listen to some live blues music. Sat for a couple of sets. Great to listen to live music again.

![](/img/img_5765.jpg)

**Friday May 13**

Up early and off to the airport to pick up our vehicle. Had to pay more, of course because our Expedia reservation was not “accurate”.  Oh well, off for the driving adventure. Thank god Giles is doing the driving. I just make sure he’s on the left side of the road.

Heading to Yorkshire today with a stop over in Hemswell Cliff Antique Centre. Multiple storied building that used to be an airforce bombing site full of antiques. A dream come true!

Found a hunting painting for Jenna, hopefully we can figure out how to get it home. The staff are going to work on this for us. Ran out of time to see all that I wanted. I think we will be comimg back here.  (Note:  Shipping was more expensive than the painting so we did not buy it)

![](/img/img_5768.jpg)

Our flat in Market Weighton is very charming and comfy. So looking forward to a decent bed and pillows. Since it is Friday night and most restaurants/pubs are booked up, we decided to make dinner and have an early night. We both felt a little stressed from the drive. Grabbed a bottle of wine and made a nice seafood linguine.

\
**Saturday May 14**

It’s market day in Beverley so we got up early and headed there. A beautiful old town with cobblestones. The market was a mix of fruits, veggies, cheeses, baked goods, and household wares. Bought some sheep’s cheese and a set of old enamel ware nesting bowls. We also spent some time in an antique centre-no purchases this time though.

![](/img/img_5776.jpg)

We walked around the town, seeing the old cathedral and then decided to head to Bridlington, a seaside resort town that dates back to Roman times. We had lunch in the church green outside the priory church- (cool overgrown gravesite).

![](/img/img_5779.jpg)

Walked the High Street into another antique store (bought an old tin) and then headed to Flamborough Head to see the two lighthouses. Walked the cliff side to see the bird rookery. Spied seals swimming in the sea. The white chalk cliffs are so wild and remote looking. 

![](/img/img_5780.jpg)

![](/img/img_5781.jpg)

Had a drink in the local pub overlooking the sea. Sad note: didn’t pay the 60p parking charge and ended up with a 25 pound ticket- dumb asses!

Next we headed to another very quaint seaside town called Hornsea that has a promenade along the waterfront. Beautiful sunny day but a little windy. We had a classic pub fare dinner at the Marine Restaurant, an old converted home looking over the sea.

Our GPS took us in a roundabout way back to the flat. A pleasant drive though through rolling hills, yellow pastures and stately manor homes.

Watched a movie tonight on Netflix called The Dig that chronicles the archeological dig of a Anglo Saxon burial ground near here. We may check it out on our way down to Cambridge.

**Sunday May 15**

Up early to head to York but not before we indulged in coffee, scones with clotted cream and jam. Of so yummy.

![](/img/img_5787.jpg)

York is an amazing walled city with narrow pedestrian cobbled stone passageways. It dates back to the Roman times with evidence of their existence in the masonry of the wall.

![](/img/img_5804.jpg)

There is also evidence of the Vikings and then the Normans masonry on the same walls.

![](/img/img_5795.jpg)

We joined a free walking tour that took us past ruins (St Mary Abbey) destroyed by Henry the VIII and to York Minister, the largest medieval cathedral in Northern Europe, dated 1220. We didn’t go in but the detailed masonry work on the outside is spectacular.

![](/img/img_5794.jpg)

We next wandered down The Shambles, a crooked narrow street that was once the butchers row due to the fact the buildings are so close together no sun can penetrate the area. I guess important to keep the hanging flesh from rotting. Rumour has it that it was called the shambles because the butchers would just throw whatever discarded meat into the street making the area a “shamble’s mess”.

![](/img/img_5802.jpg)

Now it is a quaint street with small stores on it-mostly Harry Potter wizard related due to the fact that part of diagon alley was filmed here.

We decided to spend the afternoon in the free Railway Museum. With 100 locomotives there was plenty to see. We especially enjoyed peeking into the Royal cars and seeing how the first, second and third class passengers travelled. We had a quick lunch in an area set up to mimic a rail car. We opted not to have high tea that takes place in a luxury box car seeing as we had scones for breakfast. Kept thinking how much my dad would have enjoyed this trip.

![](/img/img_5806.jpg)

From the museum we headed down to the river in search of a good pub. As luck would have it we found comfy seats facing the river and were even serenaded by Mia Kirkland, a street singer.

![](/img/img_5807.jpg)

We went to dinner at a countryside inn called the Altisidora just outside Beverley. Nice to have a sit down dinner instead of ordering everything from the bar.

![](/img/img_5819.jpg)

**Monday May 17**

First day that it appears the rain will be here all day. Oh well, won’t stop us from exploring York. Fuelled up with a big omelette breakfast and then drove into the city. Found a cheaper car park just outside the city walls.

![](/img/img_5826.jpg)

We wandered the streets and found two great antique stores where we both found treasures. Giles bought two lanterns: an old police flashlight and a circa 1911 rail lantern. I bought a silver tea strainer, 1900’s shaving bowl, dairy creamer earthenware and two decorative tins.

We travelled from Monk Gate along the city wall to High Peter's Gate which is a stretch of the old Roman wall. Very cool views into estate homes and of York Minister.

![](/img/img_5824.jpg)

![](/img/img_5828.jpg)

Wandered thru the Shambles and went to the market picking up fresh veggies and lamb at a local butcher. Made a delicious dinner tonight.

![](/img/img_5825.jpg)

Watched a Rolling Stones bio pic that was so fun.

**Tuesday May 17**

Left Market Weighton and drove thru another pretty historic town called Pocklington. Not much to see so jumped on the motorway and headed back to Hemscliff Antique Centre. Initially got lost in a waste management yard right beside the antique centre but eventually arrived and began our hunt for more treasures.

This place is amazing:six buildings full of antiques. Of course we bought more; lanterns, and silver tea strainers.

On our way to Lavenham we got hopelessly lost because they changed the roadway and our GPS got dementia. We went round the same roundabout three times until we finally turned our phone on and used our map app. Too funny! 

Decided to head immediately to get something to eat seeing as we were arriving late. Had a great dinner of paella and a nice bottle of white wine at The Greyhound. This town is so intriguing with all the crooked houses. Excited to be staying in one of them.

![](/img/img_5907.jpg)

No such luck…got the key from the lockbox but couldn’t get it to open the door! Called the emergency number but they were no help. Apparently the emergency contact person did not answer his phone.

![](/img/img_5837.jpg)

We had to book into the posh Swan Inn, another medieval crooked building. Annoying but nothing we could do about it. Hopefully we can sort it all out and be able to stay in the booked flat tomorrow.

![](/img/img_5839.jpg)

**Wednesday May 18**

Up early to a phone call from the property manager apologizing for yesterday’s check in problem. We arrived at the property only to have the host also having problems opening the door. A locksmith will look at it today. When we checked the guest book, noticed someone else complained about the front door key as well. Hope we get our money back for the missed night.  (Note:  we did)

Such a cute town with dozens of crooked Tudor timbered structures. We hope to walk around and photograph some later, today we are off to Cambridge.

![](/img/img_5848.jpg)

Bit of traffic but nothing major, what a pretty town with gorgeous century old buildings (colleges). Unfortunately since it is exam week all are closed to the public. Wandered around imagining the learning going on in King Henry VIII’s time. It is clear that the university dominates this town. Evidence everwhere of  “the gowns”, “the towns” and “the clowns” (tourists).

![](/img/img_5856.jpg)

We decided to splurge and go punting along the River Cam. Our chauffeur was knowledgeable and funny but just a little bit cynical about the universities wealth and pomp and circumstance.

![](/img/img_5857.jpg)

![](/img/img_5873.jpg)

Beautiful hot day, perfect for sightseeing and having a drink along the waters edge. Giles a little disappointed that he can’t go inside any of the colleges-guess we’ll just have to come back.

![](/img/img_5860.jpg)

Grabbed fish and chips from a vendor for dinner. Spent the night hanging around the slanted flat.

**Thursday May 19**

Today we decided to drive to Bury St Edmunds, another historical town close to where we are staying. We wandered around looking for the downtown only to realize it was right behind where we parked the car. Cute town, with cobblestone paths and of course the classic town square.

![](/img/img_5911.jpg)

Highlight of this town was the outstanding abbey that housed preserved ruins, ancient graveyards and beautiful gardens. A real hidden gem and an absolute surprise to find. So glad we came here!

![](/img/img_5896.jpg)

![](/img/img_5904.jpg)

On our way back we stopped off at Risby and took in another antique centre. Weren’t disappointed, bought a mother goose book, a pulley, two porcelain cream pot lids and some vista china ( for my collection).

Sat in the back courtyard and had a cocktail. Beautiful day! We then wandered down to #10 Restaurant for a delicious dinner of lamb (me) and steak (Giles).

![](/img/img_5917.jpg)

**Friday May 20**

We are sad to be heading home today.   The drive to the airport was uneventful - no getting lost!   Only hiccup was going through customs - I had to empty my suitcase as they looked for "weapons".  Turns out all my antique treasures (silver items) appear on the screen as "sharps".  Luckily I was still able to bring on board as we were only travelling with carry-on lugguage.

![](/img/img_5890.jpg)
