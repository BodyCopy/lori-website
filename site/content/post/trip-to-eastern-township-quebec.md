Giles and I decided to head for Quebec this afternoon so that we could cut down on the driving. Getting out of Toronto was just like old times…traffic, traffic, traffic. We stayed in a Comfort Inn in Cornwall, good thing we booked in advance as it was sold out. Turns out it is a hotel used by the rail system to house all their workers. Nothing special to report here other than it got us closer to our destination.

Spent the majority of the morning whipping along the highway, by lunch we finally got on secondary routes which afforded us quaint farm vistas and cute towns dotting the countryside. We stopped in Dunham to browse an antique shop ( no purchase) and then carried on to Lac Brome (Knowlton).



Checked out an antique shop on the drive in. Purchased a folk art chicken for Jon and a delicate iron hook for me. The owner recommended The Marina for lunch. Good choice, right on the water where the margaritas and beer were welcome. Giles had the salmon burger and I had the taco salad. It was hot on the patio but luckily had a great view of Lac Brome and there was a cool breeze.

We checked into the Lakeside Inn, an old restored stagecoach inn with beautiful hardwood and antique features. Being 40 degrees we sampled the cool pool on the terrace.

This is a sleepy town that closes up at 5:00 pm on the weekdays. We were able to grab a light dinner at the Knowlton Pub. Beer for Giles and a half pitcher of sangria for me. We chatted about how fortunate we are to have three healthy and successful children and how excited we are to be able to travel again. Early night!

Our Inn has not yet recovered from the pandemic, restaurant not open so we headed into town in search of coffee. We are centrally located so could walk. Town appeared still asleep with no restaurants serving breakfast. Heard music coming from The Sapin and luckily she was serving coffee and an egg sandwich. We’ll take it! Sat out on the patio by the river listening to a Rolling Stones tribute (in honour of Charlie Watts).

We headed to Saint Benoit du Lac to visit the abbey currently occupied by 24 monks who make exceptional cheeses. We purchased some pate de gourde canard ( duck pate), smoked Gouda, cheese curds, a baguette and wine for a picnic lunch. Before heading to the beach we stopped at a lavender farm. The lavender plants were not in full bloom but the owner was friendly and knowledgeable. He picked a fresh bouquet for me. I also picked up some essential oil, soap and dried flowers.



After looking in a few antique stores (purchased a Chinese pot and an old Coleman cooler in one spot that was more like a hoarders paradise), we headed to Douglas Beach on Lac Brome for our picnic.

Cooler today so didn’t feel the need to swim, water appeared shallow anyways but great for families with kids.

On the way back to the Inn we stopped at the Three Pines Bookstore, the headquarters of all things Louise Penny. I picked up her latest in the series and snapped a few pics. The flower arrangements dotted throughout this quaint town are spectacular.

Tonight we went to Mistral for dinner. A wonderful outdoor patio restaurant in the upper shores of Lac Brome. Ambiance was perfect with outdoor fires, twinkle lights and warm wool blankets on the backs of chairs. Giles was quite thrilled to spot Jacques Martin, the former Ottawa Senators Coach. Great meal -so exciting to be back out enjoying normal activities again.

Today is Giles’ 59th birthday! Am excited to present him with his gift later today at dinner. We headed to Bromont to spend the day poking around in the local stores.



This is a sleepy part of the province. Most stores are not open until 10:00 am and finding a spot for breakfast is almost impossible. Establishments are clearly struggling to hire back staff and to be open for the public. We wandered around, then browsed in a few stores. Our hunt for antiques was disappointing as not many stores and those that are open didn’t have much that we are interested in.



We were able to wander through an art exhibition with many vendors selling amazing original pieces. Tempted but didn’t purchase. Still hoping to find that perfect antique piece.



Tour of the countryside brought us to an amazing covered bridge.

Weather has turned rainy so spent most of the afternoon driving around the countryside. We did find a great old barn chalk full of antique furniture. I have a very vivid memory of being in this same barn almost twenty years ago. Upper level has rows and rows of chairs hanging from the rafters.



The prices were amazing so we ended up purchasing a nightstand, small dresser and and old “Eaton’s” trunk. All will have a new home at the cottage.



We had dinner at Chardo’s. Interesting appetizers of octopus and oysters. Giles had scallops and I had hen for the main and crepe brûlée for dessert. I think Giles was shocked and pleased with his birthday gift- a laser sailboat. I’m sure he’s eager to get to see it. The boat is currently sitting on Gerry’s trailer.

Managed to find a restaurant that serves breakfast in Knowlton at the Knowlton Hotel. Fuelled up and then started the long trek home. Made a few side trips but really not memorable with the exception of a really nice market store where we purchased more cheese and pâtés.

We realized that we are totally out of practice with travelling-forgetting picnic supplies, struggling to do pre planning, relying heavily on our GPS which wasn’t very helpful. We were pleased with the performance of our new Honda Pilot though, being comfortable for long trips.



It felt great to be able to visit new areas and to spend time together travelling again.
