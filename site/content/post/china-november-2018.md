  Travelling to Wuhan China with Giles to attend a Symposium at the University
  of Wuhan.  Adventures included a side trip to Shanghai.
---
**Friday Nov 9th**

Flight to Beijing was surprisingly comfortable. Flew premium economy, which provides more room, better seats and food. Giles was a couple of rows behind- not in premium :(. Thirteen and a half hours allows for a lot of movies! Next flight was only 1 1/2 to Wuhan.

Met by Ming, one of the students who took us to our hotel. Nice enough place - very large room with king bed.

**Sunday November 11th**

Walked to Wuhan University, strolled through the campus, stopping for coffee at the local Starbucks. Had a traditional lunch in private room at hotel (corn drink, pork soup, veggies, fish) then went to Hubiu Alley.

![](/img/img_3508.jpg)

Hubiu Alley on Ziyou Road is a typical snack street with local vendors selling lots of interesting things-grilled duck guts, squid, frogs, and noodles.

![](/img/img_3565.jpg)

We then went to the Yangtze River, took a boat ride to other side. Saw lots of bridges, went to Yangtze River Museum. Full of Mao photos, of him “taking the waters”.

![](/img/img_3579.jpg)

![](/img/img_4760.jpg)

We walked along the boardwalk to Yanjiang Ave Beach Park, lots of people, flying kites.The locals were staring at us, and taking photos. We are clearly an oddity here.

![](/img/img_4767.jpg)

![](/img/img_4770.jpg)

Went back to the university. Toured the Institute for Physics and Math and the MRI facilities.

![](/img/img_3510.jpg)

Went out for dinner, walking thru expensive store area called Chu River Han Street, beautifully lit up.

![](/img/img_3514.jpg)

**Monday November 12th**

Today we travelled to the Yellow Crane Tower, a traditional structure from 225 AD. We climbed 5 flights seeing amazing views of the city. 

![](/img/img_3608.jpg)

![](/img/img_3613.jpg)

Went back to Hubiu Alley, this time ate grilled squid, a lemon rice Thai dessert in bamboo and stinky tofu (really smelly, but tasted very good).

![](/img/img_4800.jpg)

![](/img/img_4801.jpg)

![](/img/img_3628.jpg)

Treated to a hot pot restaurant - very spicy and messy, needed to wear a bib. We ate bamboo fungus! I am getting better with chopsticks.

Next we headed off to East Lake, a very large park with beautiful gardens, strolled the “buggy” bridge. Went for a long walk then tackled a very steep climb up Mount Moshyan, to a traditional Chinese building for the view. Did not disappoint.

![](/img/img_4783.jpg)

![](/img/img_3631-1-.jpg)

![](/img/img_4782.jpg)

We walked around, then took trolley thru park and then taxi’s back to university. Crazy traffic, thousands of cars, scooters, bikes and people all going in various directions.

Tonight we went to a banquet style dinner again with lots of university people. In the centre of the table was a huge carousel, with very interesting food. Not North American style Chinese that’s for sure. All very yummy!

![](/img/img_3641.jpg)

Witnessed an interesting custom of the host continually toasting the guests throughout the dinner.This involves lots of drinking- clear 40 proof Chinese liquor they are very fond of. Men drink, women don’t -I was definitely an oddity which the men found amusing. All Chinese guests then roam around continuing to toast each other and us. So much food, apparently they don’t always eat like this but definitely do when entertaining foreigners. University students have bent over backwards to be helpful- not sure we could manage without them. One of the visitors even had a student help arrange his laundry and to stay with it in washer and move it to upper roof drying racks!

Traffic is crazy- cars and scooters rule the road. Many people have heavy quilted blankets as aprons in front of them to block wind, and keep their hands warm -look like huge oven mitts, often little children hiding in the apron! Construction abounds – so many cranes on skyline.

![](/img/img_3567.jpg)

A word about the “one hole”. Most toilets only have a hole in the floor-need to squat to do your business. Very awkward, also no toilet paper or anywhere to hang purse or coats so not only are you juggling your stuff you are balancing as well, hoping you won’t fall over into the hole! Tip: if you use the handicapped bathroom there is a normal toilet.

![](/img/img_3816.jpg)

**Tuesday November 13th**

We were up early, had breakfast in hotel which consisted of weird sweet coffee, (probably soy milk), eating a lot of eggs, can’t stomach all the noodle and rice dishes first thing in morning.

Spent morning hanging out in room reading, Giles at symposium this morning. Not sure about lunch, supposed to be going to national museum this afternoon.

Ming our personal student guide came to get me at hotel. Practically ran to university, guess he didn’t want to miss the talks. Arrived to hear last two speakers- pretty much Greek to me!

Had a boxed lunch, presented with a gift from Xin ( director). Handed out gifts of maple syrup (Ming, Xin and Yeqin) then off to Hubai Museum. English speaking guide helpful in showing and explaining four most important treasures. 1) Tomb artifacts of the Marquis Yi of Zeng dating from 2400 years ago. Amazing intricate carvings, vessels, chimes and a sword. Also saw skulls from early man and an Egyptian exhibit with mummies, including a baby mummy!

![](/img/img_3526.jpg)

![](/img/img_3523.jpg)

Next we were off to the art museum next door (both museums were free). Not much time to look. Little traditional or early art but did see a great contemporary exhibit. Sculpture of a crowd of people was amusing - including Colonel Sanders! I’ll call it the happy vs angry people. Actual name was “opening ceremony “.

![](/img/img_3652.jpg)

Then off for dinner- we have been eating a lot! We were in a more modest restaurant this time- private room again though as people passed by they reversed and came back to gawk and wave. Too funny!

Had duck again with the head split in half and attached. Lazy Susan eating again as well, thought I was getting better with the chopsticks until the waitress brought in forks and knives for us...ha!

![](/img/img_3656.jpg)

Early night, packing up- heading to Shanghai tomorrow morning.

**Wednesday November 14th**

We were up very early, another student escorted us to the train station. Easy to navigate however only one restaurant in upper level sold coffee. Coffee runs about 25y ($5) but tastes great!

Arrived to Shanghai by high speed train (240 mph) in 4 hours. Not much to see out window mostly rural countryside-read most of way, Giles worked on computer.

We were met by David our very fast talking English guide. It’s like listening to a badly dubbed foreign film at warp speed- eventually our brains figured it out. Good thing I did my Shanghai research on the train as it appears Ming organized our Shanghai trip without seeing anything of the Shanghai city! Quick change of plans and we are off to the Fangbang Road area that is part of old city.

![](/img/img_3661.jpg)

Lots of traditional buildings housing market wares, beautiful Koi pond, wandered the streets. Had lunch in a “fast food noodle shop”, Giles had dumplings , David and I had wonton soup- it was yummy.

![](/img/img_3665.jpg)

![](/img/img_3667.jpg)

Problem with money, my card wouldn’t work and Giles was only able to take out 3000 yuan our daily limit. Not enough to pay for full tour, this of course caused major issue- David on phone with travel agency constantly. Eventually solved, used visa to pay in full at the hotel- more about that later!

![](/img/img_4832.jpg)

We are off to the Oriental Pearl Radio and TV Tower. The observation deck, with glass floor, is 350 meters high. First though we went to a visual Shanghai history museum in the base of the tower. This museum houses absolutely stunning 3D displays of the evolution of the city. Very cool to see what it looked like in the 20th century when the British and French had concessions here -they left in the late 40’s.

![](/img/img_4838.jpg)

Then off to the observation deck- panoramic views of the city are breathtaking- city puts on an amazing light show, all the skyscrapers are lit up with moving scenes, lots of river boats - simply incredible!

![](/img/img_3675.jpg)

![](/img/img_3688.jpg)

Then a quick car ride (really it’s a private 12 person tour van-just for us) under the river to the other side, to walk The Bund. This is a wooden promenade that follows the Huangpu River. All the old original British Custom Houses, hotels are lite up and of course you get a different view of the enormous skyscraper skyline from this side!

![](/img/img_3697.jpg)

Definitely could of stayed longer here but running out of time. Jumped on bus again and now off to see the French concession area. This is a little hidden area called Xintiandi, with French style buildings from the 20th century that have been turned into restaurants and outdoor patios. A very pretty and appealing area, offering lots of different cuisine. Sadly,no time to stay, so off to hotel, which is 10k out of area.

![](/img/img_3700.jpg)

A little worried we are heading to a dive but very pleasantly surprised to find we are staying for the night in an up class Radisson.The room is very cute. Now to negotiate dinner- not crazy about eating local again but unfortunately no other style restaurants around so we found one close to hotel with David’s help. He leaves, we order much needed wine and beer and find some mushroom, rice and rib items via pictures for dinner. New problem...they don’t take credit cards! We do not have enough cash....we are short 45 yuan. Eventually decide to give us a discount. Thank god or Giles would have had to search for an ATM in the dark, which probably wouldn’t have given us money anyways! Keeping fingers crossed we can take out more money tomorrow!

**Thursday November 15th**

The day started out very promising, the breakfast at the hotel was very comprehensive with both Chinese and American style food- yummy! It went downhill from there (at least for awhile).

We headed down unremarkable freeways for three hours- yes that long! We finally arrived at a lake resort area called Taihu Lake. Our destination was a Buddhist cultural centre in Nianhua Bay. Only problem was that it was not original just a copy of temples, garden sized Buddha’s everywhere and of course many overpriced gift stores. 

![](/img/82788026_908365002961732_5485727522614149120_n.jpg)

![](/img/img_3707.jpg)

Breezed through this to jump in bus to go for another hour to Shuaiyuan, a tea pot making museum. 

![](/img/img_4875.jpg)

Before entering museum we stopped at an atm to get money in a very sketchy part of town.David tries to get us to eat in a back alley that has garbage everywhere, chickens running around...ah no this isn’t happening! 

Continue to museum...We were given a female guide who slipped on her infomercial hat and sped through the history of the little clay pot, some of it was interesting but did not result in a purchase...off we go again for another hour and a half ride back in the direction we came from.

Eventually ended up at the Lingering gardens- perfect it’s starting to rain! The gardens are part of a former officials house and date back at least four hundred years.It is overcast and drizzly but does not affect natural beauty of the stone designed walkways, huge stone sculptures and beautiful bonsai plants.

![](/img/img_3717.jpg)

![](/img/img_3718.jpg)

Around every turn is a new delightful scene. We are swarmed by group of Chinese tourists – they start taking pictures of me amongst much laughter. We are definitely an anomaly here. This is where we should have spent the morning! 

![](/img/img_3729.jpg)

![](/img/img_4892.jpg)

Crossed road to a small local noodle shop. Had a wonderful beef and mushroom noodle soup, very inexpensive and very good.

![](/img/img_3732.jpg)

A word about David here: our energizer bunny lost steam in bus, fell asleep nearly falling out of chair numerous times, was so hungry at the noodle house that he couldn’t shovel his rice dish fast enough into his mouth and looked equally perplexed about why we had driven around for most of the day and seen nothing!

Back in bus and off to Zhouzhuang, the water village. Now this place is spectacular, considered the Venice of the East. Gorgeous canals with old store fronts and restaurants lining the water ways. Mist rising off water, lanterns lighting the way, truly magical. Could of easily spent most of our day here. We went on a boat ride thru canals, very romantic...or would have been if we didn’t have David trying to take dozens of photos of us.

![](/img/img_3748.jpg)

![](/img/img_3742.jpg)

![](/img/img_4928.jpg)

Bonus- our deluxe hotel is on waterway over-looking a beautifully lit bridge-sat and drank wine on our balcony. Prior to this we wandered back thru the water village, found a smoky bar with live music and had a couple of expensive warm Coronas. Day turned out to have some definite highlights after a rocky start.

![](/img/img_3540.jpg)

![](/img/img_4990.jpg)

**Friday November 16th**

![](/img/img_3756.jpg)

We rose early to a misty cool morning. We strolled to the water bridge and wandered along canals. This is a very quaint site, watched the shop owners open their stalls for the day. Saw a woman selling a variety of fish in an alleyway.

![](/img/img_5000.jpg)

Went back to the hotel for a modest breakfast. Staff waiting for us and quite pleased to be able to serve us.

Off we go again for a long bus ride to the next town of Hangzhou. Countryside is unremarkable, mostly small urban towns with lots of industry and construction. Shocked at how many lakes, rivers and canals dot the area. Large barges carrying goods are seen everywhere floating along waterways.

![](/img/img_4993.jpg)

It is a rainy overcast day, which is unfortunate, as the town we are going to is known for it’s natural beauty. What should have been a two hour travel ended up being over three hours due to a serious traffic jam.

![](/img/img_3760.jpg)

Finally arrived and it is obvious that West Lake is a true natural and national treasure. The lake is surrounded by mountain ranges on three sides, beautiful gardens, ponds with goldfish and walking paths. We took a boat ride around the lake, it was very chilly but entertaining. We were on the boat with a large Chinese tour group all pushing and shoving to get the perfect selfie. David is camera obsessed, constantly having us pose here and there with most of the pictures cutting our bodies in half!

![](/img/img_5031.jpg)

![](/img/img_5008.jpg)

Short time in park then off to Dragon Well tea area where we climbed a steep stone staircase, which was the original tea cart trail to the tea plateaus. Main tea harvest is in March to May but bushes are lush and sprinkled with small flowers. 

![](/img/img_3767.jpg)

We went to a quaint restaurant for lunch, which served traditional dragon well green tea and a special shrimp dish made with the tea leaves- meal also included cauliflower and potato dishes that were very good.

![](/img/img_5049.jpg)

Walked then to the National tea museum where we had a lesson in green tea preparation and properties. Excellent quality and taste. We purchased enough for us and gifts for others- not cheap! Who knew green tea is supposed to be clear in colour and that you reuse the leaves for multiple days in a row! The trick is not using boiling water since this leads to bitterness. 80 degrees is perfect.

![](/img/img_5047.jpg)

![](/img/img_5054.jpg)

Getting late in the afternoon and I’m getting anxious to shop but first David insists we must see Feu Lai Feng which is a Buddhist temple made of brick and wood with a spiral staircase from 920 AD. This is an impressive 13 story structure with steep uneven steeps. Up we go...unfortunately so overcast that the view of the waterway and skyline is not that impressive.

![](/img/img_5060.jpg)

Finally off to Hefang Street, the pedestrian shopping area. 

![](/img/img_3778.jpg)

Lots of silk, tea, and souvenir shops. Beautifully lit up, streams running along side walkways. We missed the medicinal museum but did get to wander thru the shopping clinics that sell unusual Chinese medicinal products- fungi, ginseng roots, and animal parts- awesome!

![](/img/img_5073.jpg)

![](/img/img_5071.jpg)

Felt very rushed and harried as I tried to find the perfect item to bring home- settled on some tea pots to use with the expensive dragon well tea that we purchased. Should have bought some ornate scissors that they sell also which they are well known for.

Giles exhausted by all the wasted bus travel not in the best of mood. Both a little sick of Chinese cuisine so settle on the a la Cart menu at the hotel. Would kill for a glass of wine but unable to explain or find in menus. Thank god have some left in the bottle in the room. Hotel is very nice but not in a great area to explore in- more an easy freeway access hotel, close to the airport.

All in all, a little disappointed in all the wasted time stuck in the bus. This is a vast country to travel, we would probably have been satisfied to stay in Shanghai proper.

**Saturday November 17th**

We got up early and went to a large deluxe buffet breakfast in the hotel. Wasn’t adventurous enough to try the dried drunken fish or the black fungus dishes but Giles did. Said it tasted like tuna.

![](/img/img_3541.jpg)

Off we go again on the bus back to the train station in Shanghai. This time there was no traffic. However saw unbelievable construction and sweeping freeways that are often three stories high: ground level for cars, scooters, buses, middle for trains and an upper level for cars and pedestrians.

![](/img/img_3780.jpg)

Arrived at train station early. Said goodbye to our guide David, gave him a small bottle of maple syrup from Canada. Had fun trying to explain what it was. He thought it was perfume, then body lotion and then finally realized it was sweet and you could eat it...too funny. We spent an hour looking in shops while waiting to board. Beautiful inexpensive silk scarves, which I am sure I will regret not buying. Oh well, another good reason to come back.

Train was unremarkable, I read and Giles worked on his computer. Due to the high speed we arrived in four hours and were met by Shai Ling, another student and brought back to the Marshal Palace Hotel. 

Immediately whisked off to dinner in the hotel, in one of their private banquet rooms. Another professor, David, Ming, Sunny and Shai Ling joined. Food was very good, pork soup, mushroom and green veggie dishes, an abalone dish, garlic ribs dish as well as fruit and a savory sponge cake dish.

Then into a cab and off we went to Zhiyin Hao which is a drifting cruise theatre. On our way we walked along the riverfront board walk, unfortunately rainy and dark. So dark that Shai Ling stepped right off the boardwalk right into a pond, soaking both feet. We had just been commenting how treacherous the walking was when this happened. I got the giggles and couldn’t stop laughing.

The ship is a full sized replica of an original ship named Jianghua cruise from the early 20th century. You are transported back to the turn of the century and become involved in an immersive drama production. Prior to boarding all the actors in costume board the ship walking the deck as they explain why they are settling sail. All in Chinese but wasn’t too difficult to figure it out. Lots of love stories.

![](/img/img_3551.jpg)

Next we board and the inside is a beautifully restored wood and chandelier dance stage where the actors waltz to early music. Then we move to the bar area where we glimpse the drama that unfolds during a voyage with a live jazz band, and we get to enter different state rooms all beautifully decorated in period style with costumes and props to wear and watch the actors perform monologues about their particular situation.

![](/img/img_3554.jpg)

Sunny helped here with translation. Then off to the third floor where we entered our own cabin to try on costumes and imagine staying on board ourselves. 

![](/img/img_3558.jpg)

![](/img/img_3809.jpg)

Headed back to main floor to be immersed with actors, have a drink at the bar and view the skyline outside as we cruise along. An extremely impressive event and evening!

![](/img/img_3814.jpg)

**Sunday November 18th**

Leaving today...ran out to a local tea shop this morning to purchase some fermented black (red) oploong tea. Got to sample some and watch the proper way to make tea. 

![](/img/img_3568.jpg)

Hoping to pick up some gifts at the two airports. Both airports, Wuhan and Beijing only had expensive designer shops and duty free stores. Oh well, know what I will buy next trip.

Key impressions: students/university group rolled out the red carpet, no expense spared. So much food at each banquet meal, use of chop sticks for everything, rarely if ever touch food directly. Slurping, horking and nose blowing is normal. Traffic is crazy, constant ebb and flow of bikes, scooters and cars. Despite congestion and not staying in their lanes, seemed efficient and accident free. I would never want to drive here! Basically no English is spoken anywhere except by students. English signs in many places or pictures offered in restaurants. Money is a problem, they do not accept credit cards and ATM’s are not plentiful. Need to carry cash. Very prosperous country with building construction and super highways being built everywhere. Extremely clean surroundings and no evidence of anyone behaving badly. Though evidence of cameras everywhere!

![](/img/img_5089.jpg)

And the one hole was not really a problem.
