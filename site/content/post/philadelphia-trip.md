**Wednesday February 27th**



Starting the day with a blizzard outside. Not looking good for airplane travel though appears our plane is still leaving on time. Well that certainly didn’t pan out- arrived at Pearson to find that our plane has been cancelled and we are being rerouted to Philadelphia via Montreal. Storm still raging outside so apprehensive we won’t get out of TO. Went standby on an earlier flight to Montreal which ended up being delayed on the tarmac for an hour then another long wait to de-ice. Arrived in Montreal with minutes to spare,we dashed thru security only to have my boarding pass rejected due to airline error. Ran to Air Canada desk which was closing and luckily got an attendant to issue me a new boarding pass by using my return ticket allotment. Guess I’m staying in Philly for ever! Will have to sort this out tomorrow. Luckily they held the plane for us as we made our way through security and customs. Thank goodness it was virtually empty and we sailed through.

Our hotel is in the heart of the historic district. Perfect location to see all the sights. Great boutique room with funky decor.

**Thursday February 28th**



Up early with Giles. He’s off to his conference and I plan to explore the historic part of the city. Went to the Independence Visitor Center to pick up walking map and took in a city promotional film highlighting the key sights.



Very hungry so decided to start the day at the Reading Terminal Market, very old covered market selling fresh and prepared food of every variety. Reminds me of the St Lawrence Market but on a larger scale. Had to partake in a famous Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. Very good and messy. So large could only finish half of it.

Walked down Arch Street to view Federal Reserve Bank ( small exhibit inside detailing history of banking), from the outside saw Free Quaker Meeting House, U.S.Mint and the Christ Church Burial Grounds- would of loved to go poke around the old gravesite (Ben Franklins) however it was closed to the public- could only peek thru the fence.



Made my way to the Betsy Ross House (1770’s). She is reported to be the creator/designer of the first American flag. Great old preserved home. It is not lost on me that in less than a month I have stayed in the Betsy Ross hotel in Miami and now have visited her home. Interesting,have no idea what it means!

Walked down Elfreth’s Alley, a beautifully restored cobbled street with 1720 year homes that are still privately owned. Wish the museum home was open, would of loved to go through one ( only open in spring/summer).

Wandered the streets saw: The First Bank of US, Second Bank of US ( imposing Greek architecture as is the Merchant’s Exchange). Walked past the oldest tavern, The City Tavern-cool old building. Maybe head there for a drink tonight with Giles.

Also took in Carpenters Hall, which is exactly as it sounds a hall built by the carpenters guild in the early 1700’s which was formed to protect the workers and their families. It is beautifully constructed and preserved. Secrecy meetings of revolutionaries were also held here. The surrounding gardens have beautiful cobble stone roads intersecting the grounds- can just imagine horse and buggies traveling through.

Stopped at a funky coffee shop- The Custom Coffee House and had a much needed decaf americano.

Then back to the hotel to take in their complimentary wine bar- gotta love US hospitality!



Giles and I went to dinner at The City Tavern, built in 1773. This tavern was frequented by the likes of Franklin, Jefferson, Hamilton and Adams. It became the unofficial White House. Our waiters and waitress were in period costumes, antique table ware, candlelight and a harpist made the whole experience very authentic. Had an awesome meal of seafood linguini and veal medallions.



**Friday March 1st**



Snowed over night, the city is blanketed in a cloak of whiteness. Very pretty. Walked along Pine Street, eager to experience “Antique Row”. Turned out to be quite the bust, few antique stores and those that remained were closed. Headed over to Jewelry Row even though have no need or interest in shopping for rings. Dozens of stores selling new and estate jewelry. Walked through Washington Square, stopped at the tomb of the unnamed soldier.

Quick tour of Independence Hall, congress and senate chambers and a view of the liberty bell. Am a little wiser about American politics, bill of rights and the Declaration of Independence.

Headed over to Benjamin Franklin ‘s printing press shop and watched a demonstration of typesetting and the printing of flyers using eighteen century materials.



Refueled at the Custom Coffee House, then time to relax at the hotel for a much needed afternoon nap.



Had a wonderful meal at Amada, a Spanish restaurant serving awesome tapas. After dinner we headed up to Stratus, the roof top terrace in our hotel. Awesome selection of bourbons and scotches. No view though, more of a summer terrace type place. Very young crowd as well.



**Saturday March 2nd**



Giles off early for the last day of his conference. His talk is early this morning then he’s free to explore the city this afternoon.



I headed up Chestnut Street for a couple of miles to the Mutter Museum. This museum houses thousands of medically preserved oddities such as wet specimens of brains, organs, conjoined twins, fetuses. They have some many skeletons and diseased samples-actually learned a lot. Unfortunately no photos allowed.



Ate lunch at a small Italian cafe called Mix- Caesar salad and a glass of wine did the trick. Waiting for Giles to finish up.



Walked toward the art gallery, stopping at the Rodin Museum. Did not go in but toured the out door gardens which housed some bronze statues. Met Giles at the Barnes Foundation which has the largest collection of impressionist paintings, especially Renior. Very impressive gallery!



Headed back to hotel for a rest, then off to La Scalia Restaurant. Had a great Italian dinner and then took in some live music at a local pub.

**Sunday March 3rd**



Walked over to Elfreth’s Alley to show Giles the row homes, then poked around a very full and cluttered bookstore before heading to the American Revolution Museum.

Learned lots about Alexander Hamilton and George Washington. Would like to read a little more about this time period. Very good museum, we felt rushed though as had to make our afternoon plane.
