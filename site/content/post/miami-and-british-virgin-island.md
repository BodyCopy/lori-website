Wednesday January 23, 2019



Early morning ride to get to the airport for our 7:30 flight to Miami. Sailed through customs despite government shut down in USA. However grounded to a halt when we had mechanical problems in the cargo hold and then the need to de-ice the plane. Lost two hours however still arrived at 12:30.



Warm weather is a welcome relief from the freezing temps we left behind. Room wasn’t ready so left luggage and headed to a cobble stone alley full of local restaurants, called Espanola Way. We chose Italian and had a great salad and seafood risotto. We then strolled the boardwalk on Miami Beach South-miles of sand, surf and walking.



Giles headed to his meeting, I eventually got into our room (very nice). The Betsy is a cool colonial and Art Deco hotel on Ocean Drive. Perfect location and the hotel has two ocean front roof top decks-lovely!



Reception and elaborate meal on the lower ocean terrace. Threatened rain but didn’t which was lucky as we were eating in the open air. Concluded evening in the lounge with a night cap and jazz music.



Thursday January 24th



There is an incredible boardwalk directly in front of the hotel which goes for miles and miles up the coastline. Walked 3km this morning, needing to stop due to heat (80 degrees) and a blister forming in my winter covered feet.



Spent the morning on the rooftop deck by the pool. A little cool and cloudy but no complaints. Giles attending conference sessions all day-has two talks to give.



Am sitting on the front porch of the hotel observing that something big is about to happen. Lots of camera men, large black suv which appears to have security men inside and around it. Hotel staff appear excited and anxious. Going to sip my coffee slowly and wait to see who arrives!



Film crew and still camera men shooting a couple, no clue who they are or if they are the test run while they wait for the real subjects. Owner of the Betsy is here as well with his two golden retrievers (Betsy and Katie). Looks like I may be in the photos in the background with one of the dogs head in my lap!



Celebrity is Michael O’Siadhail, a visiting poet-a meet and greet in the “library”. Nope looked his photo up, not the guy I saw them filming. No clue who he is. Hotel staff tell me that they are stars from the Bravo network- won’t say which show.



Had a great group dinner at Gloria Estefan’ s restaurant, Larios, then back to the hotel for a night cap.



Friday January 25th



Cool and overcast this morning so no sunbathing today. Walked the boardwalk again waiting for Giles’ conference to finish.



This afternoon toured a collection of streets that feature buildings of Art Deco design. They especially look awesome at night all lit up in neon lights. We walked to Lincoln Road, a pedestrian walking outdoor mall where we partook in happy hour! Sat beside a couple of fellow Canadians and chatted, they are off to a Caribbean cruise trip.



This evening returned to Espanola Way and had a great seafood dinner (red snapper) and delicious tiramisu for dessert.



Night cap again in our hotel lobby with Jason and Sean, colleagues of Giles. Interesting political conversation!



Saturday January 26th



Pouring rain this morning. Glad we are off to St Thomas which is reporting excellent weather.



Uneventful flight into St Thomas, spending the night here at the Galleon House. Giles had a quick swim then we were off to explore the waterfront. Met a Swedish sailor who walked us down to the waterfront, a few restaurants available. Unfortunately the warehouse shops were all closed, Can imagine what the place would of looked like a couple of hundred years ago.. Had an okay dinner of mahi mahi and a t bone steak at a the local restaurant. We sampled their rum punch and painkiller drinks. Stopped at a local bar for some local live music before turning in.



Sunday January 27th



Up early to catch the ferry at 7:15 am. Touch and go finding a taxi then a harrowing hairpin drive to the red hook ferry terminal. Beautiful hour ferry ride to Tortola, Road Town. Met Greg and Maureen and taxied to the charter company offices at TMM for our briefing. Guys inventoried the boat and Maureen and I went off to the grocery store to provision the boat for 7 days. No small task as the store was not overly stocked.



With Earl our skipper we went on our first sail on the Beneteau 41- Critical Window III. He showed us the ropes with Greg, Maureen and Giles doing most of the work. Made a few mistakes but eventually figured out how everything worked. Nice sail at 8 knots to Norman Island. Arrived around 3 to have drinks on board and then took the dinghy to the Pirates Beach Club on Norman Island in The Bight Harbour. Awesome drinks and dinner then great live music- we even got to practice our west coast swing!



Sat up having a night cap, beautiful warm evening.



Monday January 28th



Very windy all night. None of us slept very well. Will need to get used to the tiny berths and rocky sway.



Coffee on the deck, while sipping spotted a large sea turtle a number of times. In fact today was full of sea creature sightings: saw more turtles, countless flying fish and a breaching stingray! Very cool. We snorkeled at Privateers Bay and then went by dinghy to Treasures Point. Awesome caves with great snorkeling: beautiful multi colored fish and rocks. Quite the adventure climbing into the dinghy, eventually made it with a tush push. Next time we will remember to bring the ladder.



Motored over to The Indians, four rock formations where you can snorkel. We didn’t, just had a cocktail. We put up sail, only the jib as it was quite windy. Giles and Maureen took turns steering. Made it to Peter Island where we will be mooring for the night.



Very quiet sheltered harbour. Looks a little barren and desolate. Not recovered from Hurricane Irma. We are surrounded by multi million dollar yachts that look like floating apartment buildings. Who owns these things?!?



The floating famous Willie T Bar is anchored in the bay. We went over there to sample their delicious rum painkiller drinks. Definitely feeling no pain after having two of these drinks which are mainly rum with some yellow mystery liquid tasting somewhat like pineapple with nutmeg. Maureen and I did not partake in the slap your ass ( or breast) with a tattoo antics nor did Greg and Giles don costumes and leap into the water from the upper deck. Many others did though!



Motored back to the boat drunk and had a bbq dinner of chicken and salad. Whiskey and bourbon to end the night. Less wind tonight so likely a better sleep.



Tuesday January 29th



Rose early to a promising day of sun but soon clouded over. Most of the day overcast but warm. We planned to explore Peter Island however soon realized that the hurricane has decimated the neighboring bays: Spratt Bay and Deadman’s Bay. We were unable to hike over to them as they were closed to visitors. Strolled the beach in our Harbour instead. Found cool shells and washed ashore pottery pieces. Saw pelicans, wild goats and a large fish swimming near the shore line.



Sailed at a good clip with both sails up to Cooper Island. Arrived mid day to avoid the mooring rush. We already have dinner reservations so could relax in the afternoon.



Went snorkeling, saw a large sea turtle, a number of small colorful fish and a school of tarpon and two barracudas.



Small weather system coming in so got a little wet while taking in happy hour at the Cooper Island Beach Club. Met some friendly Brits and an American family from Michigan. Snagged some chocolate rum balls at the rum store which had 300 kinds of rum to sample!



Ate at the Cooper Island Beach Club- thought about lobster but only had 3.5 pounders. We did see a guy order one for himself. Plate was almost the size of the whole table. Had shrimp, red snapper and seafood curry- all very yummy!



Quiet harbour night though water was very rolly.



Wednesday January 30th



Up early and motored to The Baths. on Virgin Gorda Island. Incredible national park with huge granite boulders that provide hidden water caverns. Initially we disembarked at a private beach, swam in only to find we were not in Devils Bay. Had to swim back to the dinghy then head to The Bath’s dinghy tie up. Should have been our first clue when we saw all the other dinghies. Walked up to the Top of the Bath’s restaurant and had a lovely lunch over looking the bay. We then hiked down to Devil’s Bay where we were able to crawl into underwater caves amongst the huge boulders. Absolutely beautiful white sandy beaches.



We then sailed for the afternoon towards Beef Island. Had a few snags with getting the sails up as Greg and Giles had different ideas of what they wanted. Scrub Island and Marina Cay have clearly been decimated from the hurricane. Looks barren and most of the restaurants are still not operational.



On Marina cay is a cute beach bar and restaurant . Had another round of painkillers then off by the free water taxi to Trellis Bay. The guide book highlighted this bay as having vibrant shops, artist workshops and restaurants. Unfortunately hardly anything is left, clearly still looks hurricane ravaged with large damaged beyond repair sailboat wrecks dotting the shoreline. Two restaurants were open but looked like they had seen better days and one gift shop. The salesperson stayed open longer once he saw us hoping for an additional sale. We did not disappoint, purchasing hand carved turtle bowl, weaved basket, t-shirt and a book.



Apparently the Trellis Bay moon festival still occurs in the evening of the full moon but it looks like they still have a lot of work to do to bring it back to its previous condition.



Took the quick water taxi back to Marina Cay and got a table for dinner overlooking the bay. Luckily it was covered as we had a good rain storm while we ate. Cute cats wandering about hoping for a hand out. Giles obiliged by feeding them some of his fish. I had grouper, Maureen had chicken and ribs and Greg had jerk chicken. Two bottles of wine later we boated back to the boat and played a hand of wizard below deck...Giles won.



Thursday January 31st



Had a leisurely breakfast of bacon and scrambled eggs- delicious! Prior to setting off we saw Jason and crew from “Life of Reilly”. They swung around to chat and then they were off.



We left the Marina under power and motored to Virgin Gorda- heading for Leverick Bay. Due to strong wind, rough waves and wind direction we motored in entirely. Got great video of the swells. Cool ride, with no one getting sick.



Leverick Hotel is a gorgeous resort with a pool, shops, showers, beach bar and upper deck restaurant. Even had a grocery shop where we stocked up on chips and chocolate. We all did a little souvenir t-shirt shopping at a boutique store and also at Pusser’s, a beautifully decorated store selling high quality clothing. Greg determined after trying on Giles shirt that he needed to go back and exchange for a different size. Maureen and I thought the whole process quite funny.



In the afternoon we took the dinghy over to Saba Island. Nothing operational due to the Hurricane. Stopped at a small beach area under construction and walked the mangroves, saw a family of goats .



Attempted to snorkel but no reef-no fish. Though Greg and I saw a stingray.



Had painkillers at the beach bar then had a welcome shower. Tonight we had an awesome meal at great seats up on the restaurant deck. The lobster, salmon and steak were all excellent as were the six dollar martini’s. Live music and dancing til closing with a bunch of Brit’s celebrating a birthday- great fun!



We all had quite a lot to drink, in fact Giles nearly fell into the dinghy twice.



Hoping tonight I have a better sleep- the mattress is rock hard unfortunately.



Friday February 1st



Better sleep- in morning boats came around offering ice, conch shells and baked bread goods for sale. After coffee we are off under sail toward Jost Van Dkye. Great wind, traveling about 5 to 6 knots. Great sail for three hours. Sailed to Guana Island into Monkey Point for a boat lunch and snorkeling.



Awesome protected inlet with the best snorkeling yet. Collectively we saw blue parrotfish, stoplight parrotfish, Black grouper, spotted drum, trumpetfish, yellow snapper and tobacco fish. Amazing sightings!



Off again to Jost Van Dyke, wind not as strong, took a couple of hours. Racing ahead of a small rain storm in order to harbour in Diamond Cay on Little Jost Van Dyke. Very quiet, sheltered bay. We all had a nap and decided to forego happy hour at Foxy’s Taboo. Hardly any boats moored tonight, only three of us ( usually we are moored with 10 to 15). Guys went to B-Line bar to pay mooring fee, grab ice and of course have a painkiller. Greg and Giles played a game of bean bag toss and signed the wall. The locals happy to have their business.



Had a great home cooked meal of Bbq chicken, cauliflower and baked potatoes, topped off with red wine and chocolate rum truffles.



Greg thought he saw a shark swimming around our boat. We all looked with flashlights but couldn’t see anything. No doubt lots of scary things down there.



Quiet night of listening to music, sipping whisky/bourbon and playing wizard- Giles won again!



Saturday February 2nd



Lazy morning, slept in and relaxed over coffee and scrambled eggs. Enjoying watching the small flying fish zip along the water.



Dinghied over to Foxy’s Taboo and hiked along beach, up mountain side by goat trail to a protected pool of water carved into the rock that makes use of the tide to produce a bubbly pool to wade in. Nice sandy bottom with little fish. Great to cool off and watch the waves crash over the rocks.



Walked back through mangroves and along beach. Giles found a beautiful conch shell. We stopped at Foxy’s for painkillers and lime in da coconut drinks.



Then off for a sail to Jost Van Dyke to moor in White bay that has beautiful sandy beaches. Only has a few mooring balls so we may not find one. Attempted to enter harbour, Giles on the bow searching for the mooring balls, thinks he sees one close to shore. Greg steering and Maureen monitoring our depth gauge. Panic sets in as the water gets shallower and shallower. Depth gauge drops to zero so we wisely decide to bug out of this spot and motor back to Great Harbour- an adjacent bay.



Lots of mooring balls here and in infamous Foxy’s is also stationed in this bay. We dinghy over to land and admire a large docile fish called the saucer eyed Porgy. Maureen nicknamed him the dough eyed fish.



Wandered the beach strip that was deserted in the heat of the day. Stopped for delicious waffle cone ice cream and then watched dozens of pelicans dive bomb for fish.



Scouted out our dinner spot and pre ordered our dinners (shrimp, ribs and mahi mahi).



Extremely hot so we headed back to boat for a quick swim, cocktail and a nap.



Our dinner at the Ali Baba was delicious, clearly a local mom and pop establishment with the owners manning the kitchen and the bar.



Headed over to Foxy’s where a dance party was in full swing. Lots of drunk locals as well as boaters. We had drinks and danced awhile amongst all the drunks then made our way back for a night cap.



Last night, sea is calm. Will be a good sleeping night.



Sunday February 3rd



Up early to head to Nanny Cay on Tortola to fuel up. Not much wind so only used the jib for awhile. Lots of ferries, super yachts and other sail boats in the channel.



Struggled a little at fueling dock but the guys there helped us dock. Fuel was very inexpensive at $55.



Our luck ran out as we came into Roadtown. We were on the wrong channel so did not make contact with the office to know exactly where to go. Instead of waiting and idling out we made our way in. Got hung up on a sandbar and got stuck. We tried to reverse with no success, eventually using a tug, dingy and unfurling the jib and the spinnaker halyard, they managed to pull us loose. Costly mistake as we lost our deposit of a $1000 for grounding the boat.



Walked to the Fort Burt Hotel which looks very rough from hurricane damage but actually is an amazing old hotel - a former fort from 1666. Our rooms weren’t ready so we hung out by the pool which was very refreshing to rinse off in fresh water.



Walked through Road Town toward the cruise ship docks which were disappointing, clearly shops and and restaurants set up for the hordes from the cruise ships. Everything closed up, ended up at Pusser’s Pub- nice nautical spot with good pub grub. Had a great meal of conch fritters, lobster mac and cheese, fish and chips and jerk chicken. Of course topped off with painkillers, and martinis. We also shared a bottle of wine.



Super Bowl on screens, have to watch!



Carefully headed back to the hotel as the ground is very uneven due to hurricane damage. Nightcap on the hotel balcony overlooking the marina.



Monday February 4th



Great night sleep on the king size bed! Woke up early to take some photos of the sunrise. Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the sea was surprisingly plentiful. Though coffee wasn’t as good as Giles made on the boat!



Walked to the ferry terminal with Greg and Maureen’s help dragging the suitcases over the cracked and missing sidewalks.



Got rid of luggage so we could shop at Pusser’s. Purchased again- love the merchandise in this store- beautiful colorful clothes. Went to a quaint coffee shop called The Island Root. Maureen got a gigantic latte, Greg a smaller cappuccino and we got tropical berry smoothies. No straws available so drinking smoothies proved challenging and entertaining. Giles tipped his to drink and quickly found it plopping into his nose and face. Discovered that using a spoon made it much easier!



Taking the 11:00 am ferry to St Thomas - Charlotte Amelie then off to Miami. Said good bye to Maureen and Greg who are staying one more night at the Fort Burt.



Our ferry from Road Town was 45 minutes late so instead of an hour and a half trip the ferry made up the time by going super fast. Sat up on the upper deck, loving the speed, sun and scenery.



Uneventful trip into Miami, unfortunately my plan to have one last fresh seafood dinner dashed as our airport hotel, The Staybridge, does not have a restaurant. Instead took advantage of their free social which provided wine, beer and “chicken” sliders. Hotel suite very nice, ate popcorn and watched a movie on HBO: Mr Brooks.



Complimentary breakfast and shuttle to airport. Back to Toronto and the cold :(.



Highlights of trip:



perfect wind conditions when sailing

Our boat, Critical Window III (a Beneteau 41) was a dream to sail and very well appointed

wonderful warm weather

Snorkeling in the clear blue water, seeing so many different sea creatures (especially Monkey Point and Treasure Point)

The Baths- unbelievable huge granite boulders, creating caves and natural tidal pools

Awesome restaurant experiences sampling seafood and tropical cocktails (painkillers!)

Dancing under the stars to live music

Hanging out and sipping whisky/bourbon on our outdoor cockpit feeling the cool breeze and seeing the stars with family



Less than ideal:



Bays and harbour services still struggling from Hurricane Irma

Hard berths and harder seat cushions in the cockpit

Wanting to do more sailing (Giles)

Grounding out the sailboat
