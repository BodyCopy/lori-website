**Monday September 2nd**

Off to a great start, breezed thru customs at Pearson and again in Glasgow. Didn’t even have to chat with a live body, passport scanned electronically and we’re are in. Only glitch on way over was me feeling ill, not sure if it was the food or altitude but nearly passed out on plane.

Now it will be the effort to stay up all day to beat the jet lag. Walked over to the Ballantrae Hotel on York Street from the Edinburgh train station, dropped off luggage and headed over to the Royal Mile. Loads of cool pubs, and miles of wool shops. Went on a hunt for tartan colours, only to find that only the most common are stocked. The architecture is amazing especially the 6 storey tenement buildings.

![](/img/img_0150.jpg)

Went to the Deacon Brodie’s Tavern ( a Scottish version of Dr Jekyll-Mr Hyde) pub and had a late lunch. Then we wandered down the Royal Mile and went to the Edinburgh Museum for some local history.

![](/img/img_0156.jpg)

![](/img/img_0134.jpg)

Weather: cloudy, light showers, very gusty winds about 18 degrees

Practically crawled our way back to the hotel with achy feet and tired bodies. Early too bed! Early to rise though...as in the middle of the night due to construction right outside our window.

**Tuesday September 3rd**

Ate breakfast at a local spot called The Square, the mini Scottish plate (which wasn’t small) had haggis. Was tasty, spiced sausage!

Met Greg and Eileen, parked the car and headed to the Royal Mile. Made our way to Edinburgh Castle. Had a mini tour and then did a self tour of the castle and grounds. Highlights included prisons, Crown Jewels, the birthing room of Mary Queen of Scots for her son James, Margaret’s chapel (1100 AD), and a stop for scones in the old horse stables. We were also present for the firing of the cannon at 1:00 pm.

![](/img/img_0160.jpg)

![](/img/img_0186.jpg)

Wandered down to the grassmarket area via Victoria Street, great street scape, inspired Diagonal Alley from the Harry Potter series. Stopped in the oldest running pub (from the 1500’s) The White Hart Inn for a much needed gin and tonic - boys had ales. Shelley and I particularly enjoyed the Boe violet and passion fruit infused ones.

![](/img/img_0203.jpg)

![](/img/img_0212.jpg)

Checked into our Georgian style home on the third floor apartment -with skylights. Quickly headed out to the Black Fox pub for burgers, more gin and a flight of whiskey. Everyone chose a different scotch...we all liked each other’s with the exception of Greg’s -Jura...ugh smelled and tasted like dirt. He loved it.

![](/img/img_0225.jpg)

Weather: overcast, rainy late afternoon-evening, 18 degrees , no wind.

**Wednesday September 4th**

![](/img/img_0227.jpg)

Boyd’s suffering from jet lag so we got a later start. Walked along Leith Walk to the Royal Britannia Yacht. Great self guided audio tour. Highlights included royal bedrooms (clearly no sex happening here in the separate twin beds), sunroom, drawing room and the upper deck (now tea room). The engine room, crew quarters and the royal barge were also fascinating. We topped off our visit with tea and scones and a pink gin drink.

![](/img/img_0229.jpg)

![](/img/img_0238.jpg)

Walked to the Leith Library hoping to find a hanging portrait of Giles’ great, great grandfather, David Low but unfortunately that tip was not reliable, though a nice librarian tried to help.

On our walk back meandered into an antique centre, ended up purchasing an earthenware dairy creamer from the Port Dundas Pottery Co from Glasgow. Got my souvenir antique! Also Eileen purchased us royal whiskey and gin crystal glasses as keepsakes. I'm sure they will come in handy!

Came back to our place for a short rest then headed out again. Walked over to Princes St, to Sir Walter Scott Monument and thru the Gardens. 

![](/img/img_0249.jpg)

![](/img/img_0251.jpg)

Walked over to The Mound and walked up to Old Town through a narrow close. 

![](/img/img_0261.jpg)

Grabbed our afternoon gin at The Beehive and then dinner at Maxie’s. Highlights there were running into Outlander Murtagh and having a Cranachan dessert after dinner. Capped off the night at the Inn on the Mile with a wee dram of whisky.

![](/img/img_0268.jpg)

![](/img/img_0274.jpg)

Weather: sunny in morning, rainy mid day, about 18 degrees.

**Thursday September 5th**

![](/img/img_0288.jpg)

Out and about early this morning, unfortunately nothing gets started until 10:00 am. Started our day at the Gladstone Lands which is a restored tenement building from the early 1500’s , the painted ceilings were amazing. 

![](/img/img_0279.jpg)

From there we went to Real Mary’s Close which also is a tenement building and the adjacent close (now enclosed and only open to tours). This building housed hundreds of people in the 16 century, many being very poor and dying of the plague. We also saw where Mary Queen of Scots was housed prior to being imprisoned.

![](/img/img_0280.jpg)

Went to a free museum called the People’s Story-history of Edinburgh people’s life and times from the 1700’s to war time. Great visual displays.

![](/img/img_0287.jpg)

For lunch we went to Ondine a very nice restaurant for seafood. All our meals were delicious: salmon pate, grilled sole, scallops, fish soup and yummy desserts. Expensive but very good. The delicious chablis also added to the expense.

![](/img/img_0307.jpg)

![](/img/img_0308.jpg)

Well off we went down the Royal Mile again (I think we have travelled up and down this street 10 times).

![](/img/img_0299.jpg)

![](/img/img_0313.jpg)

Stopped into a local garden and glanced at the very ugly and confusing “new” Parliament Buildings.

Attempted to go to Holyrood Palace however we were 4 minutes too late for last call. Oh well, took pictures from outside! Eileen and Greg went back to lodging , Shelley, Giles and I headed up to Arthur’s Seat. Only went partially up but what a view!

![](/img/img_0324.jpg)

![](/img/img_0320.jpg)

![](/img/img_0325.jpg)

Back up the Mile for our customary gin at The Mitre Bar ( had to sit outside, windy and cold), then to the Jolly Judge for a scotch.

![](/img/img_0328.jpg)

Met Eileen and Greg outside St Giles Cathedral for our City of the Dead Tour. Perfect timing for the drizzle to start. Our tour guide was very good and informative. Spent most of the tour in the Greyfriars Kirk (ancient cemetery). Wish I could of taken photos in the day as this place is incredible! Huge mausoleums and tombstones, creepy vaults and spooky real life stories about grave robbers and the Covenanters.

![](/img/img_0331.jpg)

Weather: sunny and warm. Little drizzle in evening, 18 degrees

**Friday September 6th**

Up very early and off to St Andrew’s. rough go with the navigation though Greg managed to keep us on the road and get us where we wanted to go.

Stopped off in Burntisland, located the original school, The Burgh, that Giles’ great,great grandfather David Low was headmaster of. Took lots of pictures, it has now been converted to flats. No time to visit the gravesite unfortunately.

![](/img/img_0346.jpg)

Spent the rest of the morning and afternoon in St Andrew’s. We toured the castle, including the hidden siege tunnels and then wandered the ruins of the cathedral. 

![](/img/img_0382.jpg)

Even lay in the open tomb, same one that I laid in over 30 years ago. Shelley shared the tomb as well, looked like we were rising from the dead. Greg climbed the tower-166 spiral steps. The rest of us sat in the sun!

![](/img/img_0358.jpg)

![](/img/img_0360.jpg)

![](/img/img_0392.jpg)

Had fish and chips, gin and beers at a local pub called The Central. Went to St Andrews Old Course-beautiful setting. Boyds bought some swag.

![](/img/img_0412.jpg)

Arrived in the early evening to Stalker’s Lodge in the Straloch area. Absolutely beautiful, rolling hills dotted with sheep. Our lodge is outstanding, has everything you could want -including scones and jam.

![](/img/img_0420.jpg)

Hanging in tonight around the fire, drinking whiskey and bourbon.

![](/img/img_0421.jpg)

Weather: sunny, warm, slight breeze, 25 degrees.

**Saturday September 7th**

Very exciting day - up early to attend the Highland Games in Braemar. We arrived early and found our seats in the uncovered grandstand. Awesome seats with a view of all the events including the Royal pavilion. Purchased Braemar Gathering swag before they ran out of everything. Shelley and I purchased scarves, Greg and Giles got fleeces and Eileen got a Scotland Heather scarf from a local vendor.

![](/img/img_0424.jpg)

Came in handy as initially it was very chilly but by noon the day was very sunny and warm. The layers came off and our faces got burnt.

![](/img/img_0434.jpg)

Highlights of the games included the hammer throw, caber toss, high weight toss and the tug of war events. All in their kilts! We even saw a game record set in the high toss at 16 ft. Set by a very impressive looking dude from the Czech Republic.

![](/img/img_0444.jpg)

![](/img/img_0459.jpg)

The massed piping bands piping in were amazing especially when they all marched in together and played in unison. There were 12 bands in total, each performed separately and three times all together.

![](/img/img_0522.jpg)

They had many running races including relay as well as a long distance run up and down the mountain which had a height of 1200 ft. The fastest runner did it in 25 minutes! It was fun to watch the local children competing in the sac races.

![](/img/img_0513.jpg)

![](/img/img_e0514.jpg)

Most memorial event though was watching The Queen arrive in her Bentley and sitting in her Royal Box with Camilla and Charles. In attendance was also her grandchild Peter and his wife, Autumn ( a Canadian)! She was piped out with the massed bands (12 in all). We were able to get photos when she drove right by us.

![](/img/img_0534.jpg)

Also worth mentioning was the beautiful drive through the highlands to the gathering and back. Windy roads, and the wandering bad ass sheep didn’t stop Greg from Indy driving at break neck speeds.

Wandered around the quaint town of Braemar after the gathering but too busy to get dinner so we drove to Pitlochry.

![](/img/img_0538.jpg)

All in all a very good day!

Weather: sunny, warm 24 degrees

**Sunday September 8th**

![](/img/img_0627.jpg)

Beautiful misty morning, Giles, Greg and I went for a walk up the hill spotting a hidden walled garden, grass tennis courts, logging road including a huge tractor coming down the mountain with a load of timber, an ancient glacial boulder and a Bronze Age stone cattle enclosure. Shelley and Eileen went by the lake walk, over to the island and also went into the walled garden.

![](/img/img_0542.jpg)

![](/img/img_0551.jpg)

![](/img/img_0555.jpg)

Drove to Blair Atholl and to Blair Castle. parts of castle built in 1269. Castle had many rooms to view with lots of mounted animal skulls (weird). The surrounding countryside is breathtaking.

![](/img/img_0558.jpg)

![](/img/img_0580.jpg)

![](/img/img_0595.jpg)

We stopped off in Killiecrankie to view a gorge, waterfall and old stone rail bridge. Reportedly a Jacobite had leaped 18ft to freedom when fleeing a redcoat in the 1700’s. if true, very impressive. Giles tried...unsuccessful!

![](/img/img_0610.jpg)

Drove to Moulin, just outside Pitlochry for dinner and drinks at The Moulin Inn. Awesome meal, steak and ale pies, roast beef and scampi/salmon salad. The best was the sticky whisky fudge pudding with warm custard. Giles preferred his with ice cream.

![](/img/img_0618.jpg)

![](/img/img_4373.jpg)

![](/img/img_0621.jpg)

Giles driving today, only hit the curb once and only needed one reminder to stay on the left!

We are sorry to leave this outstanding home in the middle of the highlands. Definitely could of stayed longer.

![](/img/img_0578.jpg)

Weather: cool this morning then sunny, no wind, 16 degrees.

**Monday September 9th**

Rainy morning but spectacular mist across the highlands. We are sorry to leave this area. 

![](/img/img_0622.jpg)

Well did a first today, went on a whisky tour and tasting at Edradour Distillery, drinking at 10:00 a.m. we all enjoyed this small independent run distillery, a great tour. They even gave us a free whiskey glass!

![](/img/img_0633.jpg)

![](/img/img_0641.jpg)

![](/img/img_0643.jpg)

Off toward Inverness, stopping along the way at the Dalwhinnie Distillery. Didn’t do tour but Shelley, Eileen and I had a three tasting with delicious chocolates. We all enjoyed the 15 year old so purchased a bottle for our stay in the area.

![](/img/img_0645.jpg)

Headed to Inverness, went to a restored 1639 year old church turned into a bookstore. Sold many antique books and prints. Great fun poking around here. Shelley and I purchased over hundred year old prints of Scottish sites.

![](/img/img_0648.jpg)

Had a great dinner at the Mustard Seed, getting in for the early dinner seating. Within minutes of opening it was full so we were lucky to get in. Ate too much...all had desserts that we did not need but the Edon Mess, pannacotta and apple crumble pie were delicious!

![](/img/img_0651.jpg)

Drove to Rosemarkie and despite not having directions managed to find our seaside house in the dark. At first stopped to ask for directions knocking on the door of the place that was ours..surprisingly no one answered. Luckily the owner lives in the house next door and came out to welcome us.

Weather: Rain, cloudy 16 degrees

**Tuesday September 10th**

![](/img/img_0656.jpg)

![](/img/img_0655.jpg)

Beautiful sunrise overlooking the Firth of Moray. Surprised to see ponies right next door.

![](/img/img_0660.jpg)

![](/img/img_0652.jpg)

Headed off to Culloden Battlefield. Great information display centre. Very sad and while walking the field you can see stone markers indicating the clans that suffered losses.

![](/img/img_0666.jpg)

![](/img/img_0664.jpg)

Able to get up close and personal with a few hairy coo’s. They look so beautiful.

![](/img/img_0673.jpg)

We also went to the Clava Cairns, Bronze Age temple and burial grounds. Great example of standing stones. We tried but no one passed through.

![](/img/img_0693.jpg)

We had a great lunch at Cawdor Tavern, tried not to have dessert but couldn’t do it. Most of us indulged.

![](/img/img_0712.jpg)

Went to Cawdor Castle but decided not to go in and tour. Ended up in the wool shop instead. Lori bought fingerless gloves...Giles didn’t get it.

Drove to Cromarty, at the tip of the Black Isle however disappointing as it has huge oil platforms obscuring the view.

![](/img/img_0717.jpg)

Weather: rainy, cold and windy. 15 degrees

**Wednesday September 11th**

![](/img/img_0722.jpg)

Heading to Loch Ness this morning. Very scenic route along lake. Went to Urquhart Castle, medieval ruin perched on the shores of Loch Ness. Unfortunately no sign of Nessie but did see a replica trebuchet used to destroy the castle after the Jacobite rebellion. 

![](/img/img_0724.jpg)

This castle was owned by the Grant clan for most of its life but later destroyed by the MacDonalds. It was extremely windy adding to the air of desolation.

![](/img/img_0742.jpg)

![](/img/img_e0739.jpg)

From here we drove inland through the mountains with breathtaking vistas. We stopped at a small town called Invermoriston to view the falls and an ancient stone bridge. Very picturesque! We even saw another crop of circle stones in the middle of a farmer's field.

![](/img/img_0751.jpg)

![](/img/img_0756.jpg)

Stopped at Fort Augustus for lunch at the The Loch Inn. Had a lighter lunch which turned out to be more food than we had planned on. No dessert this time though! Watched a few boats travel down the canal using the lift locks.

![](/img/img_0767.jpg)

Headed back up Loch Ness and went to Tomatin Distillery but unfortunately were too late for the tour. However we were able to watch a short movie and then sample a couple of their scotches. We all liked different ones but in the end did not purchase anything but a glass.

![](/img/img_0764.jpg)

Prior to dinner at the Anderson In Fortrose we went to Chanonry Point hoping to see dolphins or seals. Thought I saw a seal, turns out it was a black dog swimming. Extremely windy, hunted along beach for sea glass and hagstones (stones with a hole in it).

![](/img/img_0781.jpg)

Had a great meal in the Anderson, an eclectic restaurant run by an American couple. Music was being piped in by an old hifi turn table. Got to hear Rod Stewart’s -footloose album.

![](/img/img_0780.jpg)

Beautiful full moon overhanging the water tonight.

Weather: rainy, extremely windy, felt colder than it was. When the sun did come out everything glistened. 13 degrees.

**Thursday September 12th**

![](/img/img_0783.jpg)

Heading off this morning to Isle of Skye via the Dalmore Distillery. Unfortunately we needed to prebook a tour which we did not so instead had a wee dram tasting, purchased a glass and were on the road. Decided not to purchase the 14,000 pound bottle of whisky they had on display.

![](/img/img_0790.jpg)

Drove to Eilean Donan, a medieval castle of clan McCrae . It is perched on an island and is accessed by a beautiful stone bridge . The current owners still live in one wing but the rest of the keep is open. They have set up most of the rooms to view as living diaramas. Gives you a sense of how they would of lived. Couldn’t believe how narrow the passageways and staircases were. They had a room set up in honour of John McCrae, the Canadian poet who wrote In Flanders Field.

![](/img/img_0792.jpg)

![](/img/img_0794.jpg)

Long drive over the bridge to the Isle of Skye . Roads alternated between being wide and smooth to narrow, single lane and bumpy. Needed to find passing places to let others go by. Difficult when there is constant traffic and sheep oncoming. The drive through the hills was breathtaking.  Stopped to watch some fishermen pull in their catch of the day,

![](/img/img_0806.jpg)

![](/img/img_0816.jpg)

Our place at Dunhillan Ard cottage is spectacular . High up on a hill with sweeping views of the ocean. The inside is beautifully decorated.

![](/img/img_0826.jpg)

Went to eat at the Edinbane Inn, very popular local spot. We met Giles’ cousin, Donna and her husband, Neil. They have not seen each other for 42 years. They own a sheep farm, we are hoping to visit them before we leave.

![](/img/img_0822.jpg)

Back at our place for a fire and a scotch.

Weather: sunny , cloudy and rain. 13 degrees

**Friday September 13th**

![](/img/img_0828.jpg)

At the end of the road we are on, is an old abandoned church and cemetery, Trumpan. Another scene of warring clans taking revenge on each other by massacring innocents in a church while worshipping. Perched overlooking the sea, sad and desolate.

![](/img/img_0834.jpg)

Did a drive-by sighting of Dunvegan Castle, couldn’t see it from the gate so drove along the coast and got a great vista of the castle from the road. The lighting wasn’t great so castle blends in to the surroundings on our cameras.

Headed to the Fairy Pools, a series of waterfalls cascading down the mountains. Didn’t have enough time to do the entire trail so only could view the lower falls.

![](/img/img_0854.jpg)

Went to Kinoch Lodge for a four course Michelin star lunch. Just as we were arriving a helicopter landed with two gentlemen arriving for lunch.

The service was outstanding as was the food. We had scallops, pigeon breast, red pepper and olive soup, venison and salmon. Desserts weren’t too shabby either- chocolate and hazelnut torte with coconut ice cream and the other was a creme brûlée with orange sorbet.

![](/img/img_0859.jpg)

![](/img/img_0866.jpg)

The helicopter guests were sitting near us and struck up a conversation with us. We chatted about us not being American and what we had done since arriving. They indicated they were businessmen in development, oil and tourism interests. Guess so, if you can arrive for lunch from Edinburgh in your own private helicopter.

![](/img/img_0872.jpg)

Apparently a woman I met in the parking lot said the last time she was here a couple arrived in a luxury yacht, and then rowed to shore in evening attire. Guess this is the place to be!

Drove to a small gin and whisky distillery, had a tasting. Bought more glasses and a bottle of gin.

Went to Kilmore church the scene of another early clan massacre. It was definitely eery, filled with old tombstones, crumbling church walls and sunken grounds. This place is definitely haunted, was the early site of pagan rituals as well. Wish I could come back at night. Fitting we are here on Friday the 13th! Great picture taking opportunity.

![](/img/img_0889.jpg)

![](/img/img_0894.jpg)

Prior to heading back to the house we stopped at the Stein Inn (circa 1790) for a drink. Oldest bar in the area. Unfortunately could only stand at the bar as rest of place was for dinner reservations only.

Watched a Scottish movie, Calibre on Netflix tonight.

Weather: sunny with short periods of rain. 13 degrees

**Saturday September 14th**

![](/img/img_0903.jpg)

Woke to a raging wind and rain storm. Looks like it will be like this all day. Well it did rain all day but that didn’t stop us from braving the weather to do the Trotternish Peninsula. Absolutely crazy winds at 85 mph at Lealt Gorge. Tried to capture how windy and rainy it truly was on video. The wind was so strong you couldn’t walk upright.

![](/img/img_0905.jpg)

![](/img/img_0911.jpg)

Stopped at Kilt Rock for more wind and rain. Beautiful view of sea and waterfall. Couldn’t really see the rock formations of The Quiraing but still can tell how beautiful the countryside is.

![](/img/img_e0925.jpg)

Would of loved to walk around the ruin of Duntulum Castle but it was just too wet. Went to the Skye Museum of Island Life, where you could tour a number of original and reproduction thatched stone huts originally inhabited by crofters. Could really get a sense of how hard life would of been for them.

![](/img/img_0937.jpg)

Headed back to the house for much needed warm clothes, hot toddies and a roaring fire.

![](/img/img_0922.jpg)

Once back got all that plus a light charcuterie and a Scottish movie, The Outlaw King.

Went out to a Michelin star restaurant tonight, Loch Bay in Stein. Still windy and rainy so unfortunately no sunset. Fantastic seafood though. Five courses-all seafood-lobster, prawns, mussels, oysters, clams. Finished with amazing sauces. Each course and each mouthful filled with flavours. Desserts delicious too- traditional clootie with whisky sauce, soufflés and a selection of small cakes/tarts. All completely stuffed.

![](/img/img_0948.jpg)

![](/img/img_0943.jpg)

Weather: rain, high high winds (80+ mph), 13 degrees, feels colder.

**Sunday September 15th**

Must leave the beautiful Isle of Skye for Oban. We are taking the ferry to Mallaig. Very long drive today made worse with cramped quarters in the back and very windy roads.

Made a pit stop to a lookout in Broadford to see the mountain range, eagles (didn’t see any) and a small waterfall.

We drove through Fort Williams and took a side trip to Ben Nevins waterfalls. Looked exactly like a fairy glen. Took time to eat lunch in the glen.

Arrived into the cute seaport, Oban. Our three bedroom flat is in walking distance of the town. Basic accommodation with a view of the water. Only one bathroom though.

Went to the distillery tour and tasting. Another whiskey we like and another glass to take home.

Went to Oban Inn to listen to traditional music. Awesome hearing a number of musicians jamming together.

Went to Markies Dan’s for dinner. Nothing special especially after the last two days of eating splendour.

Went back to the Oban Inn to hear live music, this time a solo guitar player. He was very good, playing lots of popular tunes. The bar was full of very young drunk lads who were spoiling for a fight and couldn’t keep their hands off each other. Clearly there is a shortage of lasses in this town. Very amusing to watch them though.

Weather: cloudy with some sun. No rain :), 13 degrees.

**Monday September 16th**

Off on our island tour today. Began with a 45 minute ferry ride to the Isle of Mull. Some of us sat inside, some up on deck. Beautiful scenery. From there we hopped on a double decker coach (all sat on upper deck) on driver’s side so that we had best views of the water. Jokes on us, bus commentary pointed to stuff on the other side. No signs of otters, dolphins or whales :(.

Mull coach took an hour and half to get across island. From here we took another short ferry to the Isle of Iona. Very small pretty island with a restored medieval Abby and nunnery. Settled in 563 AD by Columba. Great audio guide.

Also stopped in the Martyr’s Cafe for fresh wine and garlic mussels. Yum, yum. Left this island in late afternoon and repeated the trip back to Oban.

Outside the ferry terminal, a little shack serving fresh seafood. Greg, Eileen and Lori partook of the very fresh oysters.

Went to dinner at The Seafood House, food looked great. Scallops, langostinas, chowder, Lori and Giles not feeling well came back early.

Weather: cloudy, sunny bursts, 13 degrees

**Tuesday September 17th**

Went for a “real” breakfast this morning at a little local dive called Abbie’s. The owner was a true Scott’s, standoffish at first then keen to share his knowledge about sailing and the lift locks at Falkirk.

Drove to Stirling Castle. Long windy road through Lomond and Trossacks National Park.

Beautiful scenery, first full sunny day in weeks.

Toured Stirling Castle and learned about the early history of the castle. Basically it changed hands numerous times between the Scots and the English. They have restored the castle to how it would of been in 1560’s. I thought the great halls, private chambers and chapel were too sparsely decorated and very bare. Not sure that it would of been so in the day. They did a really good job of displaying the kitchen area though.

On the way to Glasgow stopped at Falkirk to see the lift wheel. Pretty amazing technology of moving boats down the canal.

Arrived at Sherbrooke Castle Hotel in the late afternoon. Greg and Eileen scored the tower suite which is quite unusual. We are in a large, high ceiling room without the interesting details.

Giles has been feeling ill all day so didn’t join us for dinner. Food quite good but ate too much. (Sea bream,scallops, venison, chicken pot pie and various sweet desserts)

Weather: sunny, 17 degrees

**Wednesday September 18t**h

Sad day today, saying good bye to Giles as he heads back home. Prior to heading to the airport we drove around the neighbourhood checking out the “middle class” mansions. Quite spectacular seeing as these homes appear to be still single family occupied.

After dropping Giles off we drove to the Motherwell area to find the home Shelley’s grandmother lived in the 20’s. took pictures of the house only to have a noisy neighbour next door come out and ask us questions. Quite helpful, pointed us across the street to a woman named Watts (same name as Shelley’s grandmother). She ended up being no relation but was very friendly. Back to the other neighbours who’s husband had now joined her on the street, only to tell us that the home we thought was Shelley’s grandmothers was built after WWII. Mystery...not solved.

After a few wrong turns drove to Glasgow Cathedral and the Necropolis. Huge tombstones and mausoleums clearly for the wealthy merchants in the Victorian era. Also visited the oldest house in Glasgow (1471) and herb garden. Able to view three floors of this old priest’s house, The Provand’s Lordship.

Arrived in late afternoon to our new place, pretty basic but centrally located. Walked to Sauchiehall St and went to the Willow Tea Room for afternoon tea. Lots of sweets in a very cool architecturally designed building and interior from the art nouveau era-a MacIntosh design.

Continued to walk down Sauchiehall Street, a little seedy pedestrian shopping mall.

Back at the unit for an early night and to plan for the day tomorrow.

Weather: cloudy but warm 18 degrees.

**Thursday September 19th**

Jumped on the Hop On/Hop Off bus and did the complete loop with taped informative commentary and amazing antidotes. We got off at the People’s Palace and winter garden. Great Victorian fountain donated by Doulton depicting the British colonies. The People’s Palace had many displays of early Glasgow life. Unfortunately winter garden was inaccessible due to structural weaknesses.

Shelley and I took a detour to Barres Market to antique shop only to run into a kind gentleman who explained that the shops were only open on the weekend. Guess we are going back on Saturday! Stopped off at the Rumbling Tum for a quick coffee and toastie.

Met up with Eileen and Greg at the City Chambers Building on George Square. The inside of this building is outstanding with all the marble and mosaic work. Got extra photos as Greg wandered up the stairs into the forbidden area.

Greg headed to The Lighthouse (Macintosh architectural museum) while we went in search of the street murals. Eventually found a few though some on the list appear to be gone now. Left Eileen back at The Lighthouse to meet Greg will Shelley and I carried on to find more murals. We found a couple down an alley which led to a delicious gin in Sloan’s Pub (circa 1791).

Wandered back along St Vincent Street to The Griffin, a quaint pub outside the place we are staying . Eileen and Greg met us there for dinner. More gins and gougons (chicken fingers) for dinner.

Off to King Tuts Wah Wah Hut to see Velvet Starlings. Turned out there were three bands, each playing for half an hour. The Revelations, Velvet Starlings and Morning Retake. Well what can I say...the venue is sparse, just an open floor and stage. Can hold 300 only about 45 people there. All extremely young kids in early twenties and their friends/family. We definitely looked like someone’s mother. I wouldn’t say it was horrible, entertaining and definitely raw. They sounded better on YouTube. Some very big names have played here, unfortunately not tonight.

Have revised our opinion of Velvet Starlings after we researched him and found out he is only 16 years old. Quite an accomplished musician for his age, playing electric guitar, keyboards and lead vocals on all songs.

Weather: sunny and very warm, 23 degrees

**Friday September 20th**

Shelley’s birthday today. We are heading on the hop off hop on and going to the Kelvingrove Art Gallery. A beautiful red sandstone building built in 2996 originally as a private mansion. Of particular interest was the Linda McCartney special exhibit of her photography. Hundreds of early photos of the Beatles, Stones, Janis, Hendrix and especially photos of her home life with Paul and her four kids. Great shots of their Scottish farm as well.

Also checked out the French artists, The Glasgow Boys (Scottish group of artists). Was most impressed with the Macintosh exhibit of furniture, stain glass, and pottery from the art nouveau era.

Walked thru the Glasgow University grounds which reminded Eileen of Hogwarts and over to the Hunterian Art Gallery. Greg toured the “Macintosh Rooms”. We opted for a shady grass hill to take a much needed rest.

Wandered down to Ashton Lane, a cute alleyway of restaurants and bars where we stopped for a much needed refreshment. Had dinner at The Bothy. Scallops, beef, sea bass and more STP (sticky toffee pudding) made for a delicious meal.

Walked back to the unit thru two new areas: Woodland and Charing Cross. Beautiful mild night.

Weather: sunny, warm, 25 degrees.

**Saturday September 21st**

Up early to go to Barra’s Market an alley flea market. Made our way there by uber only to arrive to find the Scots are late risers and in no hurry to open up. Went back to the Rumbling Tum for a full fry breakfast. Wandered the alleys and found a number of antique shops selling a large amount of china and various odd items. Did find a few treasures: silver serving spoon, crockery, glass bottles embossed and a trivet. Stopped in the oldest sweets shop to buy some candies as well.

Went in search of new street murals, found a few more. Went up Buchanan Street, the pedestrian shopping street. Stopped at an outdoor cafe for drinks and pizza.

Headed back thru the city centre to spend some time at the unit before heading out for the evening. Went to Palominos for dinner, a local burger joint on the road outside our place.

Tonight we went to Swing an underground 40’s style club. Listened to a jazz singer on piano named Mariana McGregor. She was very good playing Amy Winehouse and Michael Bible songs. However as the crowd thickened it became much harder to hear her.

Great people watching as many groups were celebrating birthdays. We had great seats so could watch the performances as well as the antics of the audience. Second act was The Shivering Sheiks, they were a very tight swing band playing many 1940’s and 1950’s hits. Topped off the night with a guest performer who sang Etta James’ At Last. Great night!

Weather: full sun, 25 degrees

**Sunday September 22nd**

Went to a great breakfast spot called Singl-end, which refers to the one room tenements that are popular in this area.

Walked over to a National Trust tenement home that was open and free today (being part of Open Doors Glasgow. Awesome preserved turn off the century home that consisted of a kitchen, bathroom, parlour and bedroom, as it would of looked in the 30’s.

Also stopped briefly in a synagogue that was also part of Open Doors Glasgow.

Went down Sauchiehall Street collecting souvenirs: woollen socks, cool unique gin bottle, a book about Charles Rennie Macintosh and Scottish shortbread.

Went to dinner at the Butterfly and Pig Pub. Had a plate full of root veggies and roasted duck, Greg and Shelley got the roasted beef. Eileen had the sea bass. Huge portions but we still found room to share an STP.

Weather: showers off and on all day, cloudy, 18 degrees.
